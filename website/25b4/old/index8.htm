<H3><A NAME="TOC68">Setting-up A Virtual Host</A></H3>

<P><EM>Virtual hosts</EM> means running multiple virtual web sites on
one system.  This is commonly used by web site providers, but can be
useful in all kinds of organisations.  There are two ways to configure
your IP system to permit virtual hosting:
<OL>
<LI>You can assign multiple IP addresses to a system, a technique that
is called 'multihoming'.  An IP address refers to a connection point
(e.g. a network card) to a system, rather than the system itself, so
it's quite normal to have multiple IP addresses.  Many network cards can
support multiple addresses (4 or 8), and most systems can take multiple
network cards.  There are probably routers and gateways that make it
possible to have thousands of IP addresses on one system.
<LI>You can assign the same IP address to lots of host names, using DNS
or something similar.  Thus, 'www1.some.domain' and 'www2.some.domain'
can refer to the same address. This is often called a 'virtual host'
because the host does not exist as a separate computer, just as a name.
</OL>

<P>Xitami can work with both these mechanisms for HTTP and FTP connections.
It handles multiple IP addresses automatically: if you ask it to run on
port 80, it will accept connections on any IP address, on port 80. You do
not need to configure this (although you can restrict it to run on one
specific address). This means that you do not need to specify on which IP
address Xitami should accept connections - if a system has ten IP
addresses, Xitami will accept connections on all ten.

<P>A multihomed virtual host is identified by its IP address. A DNS-based
virtual host is identified by its name:

<PRE>[Virtual-Hosts]
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx=filename.cfg   #  A multihomed host
    www.some.domain=filename.cfg   #  A DNS-based virtual host
</PRE>

<P>DNS-based virtual hosting requires a DNS server or something similar. The
mechanisms for setting-up both multiple IP addresses and multiple domain
names are system-specific; you should have access to technical documentation
for your TCP/IP configuration or good technical support. DNS-based virtual
hosting uses a HTTP/1.1 feature called the 'Host:' header, and an FTP feature
whereby the user name is specified as 'user@<I>hostname</I>'.  Most modern
browsers support this; if you are building an intranet it is quite easy to
be sure that all browsers will work correctly with DNS-based virtual
hosting. On the Internet you can catch browsers that do not send a valid
Host: header, and show some specific pages.

<P>The SSL protocol used in Xitami/Pro cannot work with DNS-based
virtual hosts, so to use SSL virtual hosts you must have a unique IP address
for each host.

<P>When you set-up a virtual host, you will generally want to use a specific
directory for the web pages, CGI scripts, password file, and log files. (You
can also share these in any way you need to.) You can also configure options
such as the HTTP error messages, timeouts, security, and so on.

<P>To define these, you specify a configuration file per virtual host. The
virtual host configuration inherits all definitions from defaults.cfg (and
xitami.cfg). You need only define those options that are specific to the
virtual host. If the HTTP request refers to a host name or IP address that
has not been configured as a virtual host, the request is handled by the
<EM>base host</EM>. To configure the base host, create a file called
'basehost.cfg'. You can change this name in the defaults.cfg file
server:base-host option.

<P>This is a typical configuration for a site with several virtual hosts:
<PRE>[Server]
    webpages=websites/hostx/webpages
    cgi-bin=websites/hostx/cgi-bin
</PRE>

<P>Some of the options in the [Server] apply to the entire server globally,
and are not taken from the virtual host configuration file: background,
customise, debug, limit, portbase, and refresh.

<P>When you define a multihomed virtual host, you must specify a
server:hostname value. This should be a host name that translates back into
the correct IP address. The server:hostname option is used whenever Xitami
has to return a 'redirected' URL; for image maps, incomplete URL, and
directory listings. If you do not define server:hostname, or define it
wrongly, these functions may not work.

<P>When you define a DNS-based virtual host, Xitami takes the name as a
default value for the server:hostname option. This usually works correctly,
but you can override it if necessary by adding the server:hostname option
explicitly. To avoid confusion, make sure your DNS server is correctly
configured. You normally use 'ping' to test that this works.

<P>The virtual host configuration files, must exist when the server
starts-up. You can modify the virtual host configurations on-the-fly, as for
the normal configuration files, but if you want to add or remove a virtual
host you must stop and restart the server (for instance using the WBA
control panel.)

<H3><A NAME="TOC69">Debugging Virtual Hosts</A></H3>

<P>Since virtual hosting means playing with a lot of config files,
this can quickly become confusing if you don't take some basic care
and precautions.  We advise you to:
<UL>
<LI>Keep the extension .cfg for all config files.  This lets you
distinguish the config files from other files.
<LI>Use filenames that match the host name.
<LI>Use a directory structure that matches the host names.
<LI>Only specify those options that are not the defaults.  This
allows you to focus on the specific virtual-host options that
you've defined.
</UL>

<P>If you have 'not found' errors that you can't explain, set the
server:debug option to 1 and recreate the error. Then, the log files
'debug.log' contains detailled information about the URL translation. You
can look at this file, or in serious cases, send it to us and we'll try to
help.

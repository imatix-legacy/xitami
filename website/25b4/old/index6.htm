<H2><A NAME="TOC64">Using SSI and Filters</A></H2>

<P>Xitami supports filter programs in Perl, C, or any other language that your
system supports. A filter program runs when the HTML page is displayed,
unlike a CGI program, which runs when the user posts data from a HTML form.
Xitami provides a standard SSI filter (PerlSSI) which requires a Perl
interpreter. This is not meant for heavy-duty work, but is a good example of
a filter. (We intend to develop a fast SSI module that will be embedded into
the server directly.) Another example of a filter program is PHP 3.0, which
Xitami supports.

<P>To add your own filter programs, you add an entry in the [Filter] section
of the config file. A filter program is invoked whenever a file with the
appropriate extension is displayed.

<P>Filter programs need to respect the rules for CGI programs. That is, they
should generate the same type of header (Content-Type: text/html). Filter
programs also get the standard CGI environment, and are subject to the CGI
timeouts and other constraints set in the [CGI] section.

<P>When you POST to a filter program, the form data is supplied on the
standard input as for CGI programs. When you use the GET method, the file
that is being filtered is provided on the standard input.

<H3><A NAME="TOC65">The SSI Filter</A></H3>

<P>SSI (server-side includes) is a fairly standard syntax which you can read
about on the <A href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html">NCSA</A> site. We implemented all the common SSI tags in the
PerlSSI filter. To use this, you need Perl on your system (it should be on
the PATH). The PerlSSI filter is slow, and meant as a work-around until we
implement SSI the correct way, in the server itself. The PerlSSI filter is
located in the Xitami directory itself. To run it, you must have Perl
installed. The requirements for this filter are the same as for a Perl CGI
program.

<P>By default, Xitami recognises any document with extension '.ssi',
'.shtm', or '.shtml' as an SSI document. This is defined in the [Filters]
section of the configuration files.

<P>The SSI documents are placed in the normal web pages directory, and are
recognised purely by their extension, not the path.

<P>Xitami supports these SSI tags:

<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Element syntax:         <TH>Effect:</TR>
<TR><TD>#config errmsg="text"
    <TD>Specify the SSI error message.
<TR><TD>#config sizefmt="format"
    <TD>Specify whether file sizes are shown in full, or abbreviated.
    Use the format 'abbrev' to show abbreviated sizes.
<TR><TD>#config timefmt="format"
    <TD>Specify the format used for file times. By default this
    is: "%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z". Note: the current implementation of SSI
    ignores the timefmt, and always uses the default time format.
<TR><TD>#echo var="variable"
    <TD>Output the value of the specified variable. Xitami recognises these
    variables: DOCUMENT_NAME, DOCUMENT_URI, DATE_GMT, DATE_LOCAL, LAST_MODIFIED,
    and any environment variable (including the standard CGI environment variables).
<TR><TD>#exec cgi="pathname"
    <TD>Outputs the result of the CGI program, which must be in the CGI binary
    directory (it cannot be on a CGI alias directory). Note that the CGI program
    runs in the main Xitami directory.
<TR><TD>#exec cmd="command"
    <TD>Executes a native command and includes the output of this command. Note that
    the command runs in the main Xitami directory. This SSI command - which is a
    potential security risk for your system - is only accepted if the environment
    variable SSI_INSECURE is set to 'yes'. (Under Windows NT, in the System Control
    Panel, under 'Environment'; under Windows 95 by adding 'SET SSI_INSECURE=yes'
    to the autoexec.bat.)
<TR><TD>#include virtual="filename"
    <TD>Includes the contents of the specified URI, which is assumed to be within
    the webpages root. Note that aliases are not supported in the current
    implementation.
<TR><TD>#include file="filename"
    <TD>Includes the contents of the specified file, which may be anywhere in the
    file system space.
<TR><TD>#flastmod {virtual|file}="filename"
    <TD>Outputs the time that the specified file was last modified. The file can be
    a URI within the webpages root, or an absolute filename, depending on whether
    'virtual' or 'file' is specified.
<TR><TD>#fsize {virtual|file}="filename"
    <TD>Outputs the size of the specified URL or file, using the sizefmt.
</TABLE>

<P>With a small knowledge of Perl, you can easily modify the Perlssi filter
to add support for other tags.

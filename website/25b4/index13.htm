<P><B>1: When I try to use the /admin setup, Xitami asks for a password!</B><A NAME="i_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Create two files:
<OL>
<LI>defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut
</PRE>
<LI>defaults.aut:
<PRE>[/Admin]
    admin=verysecret

Now use userid 'admin' and password 'verysecret' to access the WBA.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: Help - I don't understand how to define users and passwords!</B><A NAME="i_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami uses two separate user/password systems, one for web pages and
one for FTP access.  To start with, create the defaults.cfg and defaults.aut
file as described above.  Then, for each webpage directory you want to
protect, add an entry in defaults.aut.  Enter the URL directory with or
without a leading '/' - it does not matter.  Add each user with their
password.  For instance, to say that only 'John' and 'Janet' can get at
webpages starting with '/personal', you write something this:
<PRE>
[/personal]
    john=Go96xas883
    janet=Yhs7gsr73
</PRE>
(I'm inventing silly passwords here.)
<P>For FTP access, you need to define each FTP user separately.  First, add
these lines to defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Ftp]
    Directory-file=ftpdloc.aut
    User-file=ftplocal.aut
</PRE>
Now you can edit ftplocal.aut to define users.  The file ftpusers.aut shows
what's allowed.  For example, to define an 'anonymous' user, who connects to
the ftproot/pub directory with read access only, write this in ftplocal.aut:
<PRE>[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=/pub
</PRE>
<P>A fairly classic setup is to define a personal web space for each user
which they can update using FTP.  Be careful with this, since it's possible
to set things up so that any user can run a CGI program (unsafe on Windows
systems).  However, this is how you do it:
<OL>
<LI>For each user, create a directory below the ftproot with the user's
short name.
<LI>Create an FTP account as described above.  Use the access rights GPD,
and MR if you want allow them to create/remove directories.
<LI>Define an HTTP alias that points to this directory.  For instance, in
defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Alias]
    john=ftproot/john
</PRE>
<LI>If you also want these webpages to be private (password protected), add
an entry to defaults.aut:
<PRE>[/John]
    john=Gsh65sgs12
</PRE>
</OL>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>3: Can I refer to an environment variable in the webpages setting?</B><A NAME="i_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes.  For example, if you defined the variable WEBROOT to specify the
webpages location, use $(WEBROOT) in the webpages setting.  Note that
environment variables are set in your startup script at the operating
system level (e.g. .profile under Unix, autoexec.bat under Windows 95).

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>4: I've screwed-up my installation and nothing works - Help!</B><A NAME="i_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you edited xitami.cfg, you have to get the original version back out
of the Xitami zip file or installation package.  Under Windows you can use
Winzip or unzip to extract files from the .exe packages.  If you only worked
through the WBA, you can delete defaults.cfg.  See the previous question for
defining a new admin user and password.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>5: I installed Xitami two days ago, and now I can't connect to it!</B><A NAME="i_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You probably set the server IP address to something.  Delete the line
ipaddress=xxx in the defaults.cfg file.  If you really grok it, delete
defaults.cfg.  See the previous question.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>6: What is a 'HTTP port', actually?</B><A NAME="i_6">&nbsp;</A>
<P>It is a TCP/IP port that is used for HTTP. (HTTP being the HyperText
Transfer Protocol, the means by which web pages, etc, get transfered around
(usually).)

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>7: Why do web servers want to use port 80 by default?</B><A NAME="i_7">&nbsp;</A>
<P>In order to contact a program running on another computer via TCP/IP
(such as, say, a web server), you need to know two things: the IP address of
the other computer, and the TCP/IP port on which it is listening for
requests. The URL always includes the name of the other system (or its IP
address), from which you can get the IP address that you need. The TCP/IP
port </I>can</I>be included in the URL, but usually isn't. So you need
another way to find out the URL. Of the various ways that this could be done
(ask someone/another computer, guess, etc), the one chosen for most TCP/IP
services is "you just know what it is". That is, there is a "Well Known"
port number for most TCP/IP services including HTTP, which "everyone knows",
and if nothing else is specified then that is the one that is used. The
"Well Known" port number for HTTP is 80. So the servers want to use it by
default so that everyone will know where to find them by default.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>8: Is there some way to disable the WBA completely?</B><A NAME="i_8">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes, set the security:admin option to 0.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>1: do I know that my personal config 'xxx.cfg' is being loaded?</B><A NAME="How_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Edit the config file and add a line '! Loading xxx.cfg'. Now, enable
server debugging, and when you start Xitami, this message is output to the
debug.log file.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>9: Why does the installation replace my xitami.cfg and .aut files?</B><A NAME="i_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>It has to do this, since new versions of Xitami may depend on updated
.cfg and .aut files. The important thing is to make all changes in
defaults.cfg, and this includes defining your own .aut file, so that the two
standard files can be reinstalled at any time.
<P>The installation will not override other files, except those provided as
standard in the install package (e.g. default.htm).  So, as a general rule,
do not modify anything that was supplied as standard, and if you're really
paranoid, make a backup before you re-install Xitami.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>10: How do I install a new version of Xitami without losing my config?</B><A NAME="i_10">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Firstly, make sure you did not change either xitami.cfg or xitami.aut.
If you did change these, put your changes into defaults.cfg and
defaults.aut, and add this to defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut
</PRE>
In principle you can now re-install Xitami safely.  The installation will
not overwrite anything else you modified, including log files, web pages,
CGIs, etc.  However, for safety, make a zip of the whole Xitami root before
re-installing, just in case.  You should do this regularly anyhow.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>11: Can I install Xitami on a system that already has a web server?</B><A NAME="i_11">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you are already running a server on port 80, you must configure Xitami
to run on some other port.  Change or create defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[server]
    portbase=1000
</PRE>
will run Xitami on port 1080.  The portbase is also added to the standard
FTP port of 21 to give, in this case, 1021.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>12: How do I change the HTTP port but leave the FTP port at 21?</B><A NAME="i_12">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can shift the HTTP port between 80 and 100 while leaving the FTP port
at 21.  Set the server portbase to a value between 1 and 20, and subtract
this from the FTP port setting.  So, to move the HTTP port to 90, set the
portbase to 10, and the FTP port to 11.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>13: When I'm not connected to the network, Xitami is VERY slow!</B><A NAME="i_13">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Under Windows 95 and NT, your network configuration must match what's
really going on. For instance, if your TCP/IP configuration specifies a
particular gateway or DHCP server that is not available (because you are not
physically connected). Check that the host and domain info in the DNS tab of
the TCP/IP properties in the network control panel matches the info in the
identification tab of the network control panel.
<P> One typical symptom is that when you click on the Xitami icon in the
taskbar, it takes a minute or two before the Xitami window appears. You may
also get error messages when trying to point your browser to 127.0.0.1. The
bottom line is this: if you want to run your PC off-line from the network,
you must ensure that your PC's network configuration matches. There are
various shareware tools that help you to manage multiple network
configurations, for example NetSwitcher.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>14: 'ping 127.0.0.1' works but I can't connect to http://127.0.0.1/</B><A NAME="i_14">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There are many possible causes of this problem.  The ones we know:
<OL>
<LI>The browser simply won't connect at all... you probably told Xitami to
use a specific IP address, which excludes accesses via 127.0.0.1. Solution:
delete any line 'ipaddress=xxx' in defaults.cfg.
<LI>If you're using a proxy server, first try to disable this completely.
If this improves things, now reconfigure the proxy settings so that the
local addresses (127.0.0.1 and localhost) get past.  If this still fails,
you may need to define an entry in your 'hosts' file for 'localhost'.
<LI>Your server may be behind a proxy server that is not allowing HTTP
connections to get past.  See your network administrator.
</OL>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>15: I can connect to http://127.0.0.1/ but not http://127.0.0.1/admin</B><A NAME="i_15">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There are many possible causes of this problem.  The ones we know:
<OL>
<LI>You may have an old version of Xitami. Make sure you're running at least
version 2.0.
<LI>You may have installed a new version of Xitami but kept the xitami.cfg
from an old installation. This can leave the WSX definition for /admin
undefined, so /admin will not work. Symptom: you get 'not supported' as an
error message.
<LI>If you're using Xitami under Windows 3.x, the /admin WBA is not
supported.  The 32-bit 'console' version of Xitami can run under Win32s.
</OL>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>16: Why does 127.0.0.1 not work with proxy servers?</B><A NAME="i_16">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The problem is that if 127.0.0.1 is passed to the proxy server, it can't
resolve that back to your local machine. You can configure your browser so
that certain addresses (127.0.0.1) are not passed to the proxy.  This is
actually the browser being really silly, because this address never means
anything else than 'this machine'.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>17: Why does my server address switch between 127.0.0.1 and 253.239.42.1?</B><A NAME="i_17">&nbsp;</A>
<P>127.0.0.1 is always available (it's the local loopback address); the
other address is available when you're online and connected to the outside
world.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>18: I want to test a site but my browser can't find 'www.myhost.com'</B><A NAME="i_18">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Edit the 'hosts' file (in the Windows directory, and you may want to
rename 'hosts.sam' to 'hosts'), and point the your site name to 127.0.0.1.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>19: What's the 'document root'?</B><A NAME="i_19">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The document root is the directory where the main files are. For example
if someone asks for a file "http://somehost/index.htm", this is taken to
mean 'index.htm in the document root'. This is usually the directory called
'webpages' in the Xitami directory. So if you installed Xitami in c:\xitami,
the index.htm file would actually be in c:\xitami\webpages\index.htm. This
webpages directory can itself contain subdirectories, of course.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>20: Do I need two computers to use Xitami?</B><A NAME="i_20">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can use one computer as a server, and one as a client if you like,
but you can also use the same computer as client and server. Xitami is so
small and fast that you can develop Java or CGI programs on the same system
you test them on, and you will not notice any slow-down. This is also a
simpler way of working than always copying your webstuff to another machine.
Just set your Xitami cgi-bin option to point to the directory where you
build your executables, or the webpages directory to your HTML directory
root.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>21: Can I run Xitami on stand-alone machine?</B><A NAME="i_21">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can certainly run Xitami on a stand-alone system. It is a Good Idea
to have TCP/IP networking installed (on a PC, go for Win95, OS/2, or Linux,
which have TCP/IP built-in, instead of Win3.1 which is crippled in this
area). You must install TCP/IP correctly and at least have a dial-up adaptor
(software) configured. The 'ping localhost' command must work. Under Windows
the winsock library may want to dial-up when you initialise it (e.g.
connect from your browser), but this can be configured (in the browser or
Internet control panel) to not be necessary.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>22: Can I run Xitami under DOS?</B><A NAME="i_22">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Which version of DOS? We've not tested Xitami on a pure-DOS system, but
it does run in the DOS box of Windows 95. If you're looking for something
that will run on a PC without Windows, you could consider OS/2 or Linux:
both run Xitami very well and with minimum hardware.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>23: Can I use Xitami over an ISDN or dial-in connection?</B><A NAME="i_23">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes, if TCP/IP works and the 'ping' command does something useful. The
Same goes for X.25, frame-relay, carrier-pigeon, and telephone drums.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>24: How do I change my IP address?</B><A NAME="i_24">&nbsp;</A>
<P>By default, Xitami accepts connections on any available IP address.
If you have multiple IP addresses, Xitami accepts connections on all of
them.  More usually under Windows you have only one network card, only
one IP address (though with a dial-up connection you have two interfaces
and two addresses).  You can also configure Xitami to accept connections
on a specific address only.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>25: Xitami is reporting the wrong server address!</B><A NAME="i_25">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami gets its name from the operating system.  Check the  TCP/IP
configuration and especially the computer name.  You  should be able to
test this using the 'ping' command in a DOS box.  Eg. 'ping mysystem'.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>26: How do I tell Xitami to use my domain name?</B><A NAME="i_26">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami works with any of the IP addresses available on the system. It
does not care what the domain name is, and there is no way to define this
within Xitami. (When you use virtual hosts the situation changes a little:
there the domain name is used as a key to chose which virtual host to work
with.)

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>27: How do I move my web site to an Internet domain name?</B><A NAME="i_27">&nbsp;</A>
<P>See the <A href="index10.htm#beginners">Beginner's Guide</A> section. You have to do two main
things:
<UL>
<LI>Register a new domain name with Internic.
<LI>Get at least two existing machines to act as DNS servers for
this name.
</UL>
<P>This is usually only worth doing if you have your own system, permanently
connected to the Internet, or you want to rent a 'virtual host' on someone
else's system. In the first case, your ISP can usually help set things up.
In the second case, the virtual host provider will be able to help.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>28: Can I set my hostname in xitami.cfg or defaults.cfg?</B><A NAME="i_28">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You cannot set your system hostname here. You have to get this working at
the level of TCP/IP itself, e.g. by using the hosts file or a domain name
server (DNS). However, you can specify the hostname that's used in
redirected URLs, and this is important for virtual hosts.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>29: My server keeps starting on port 160, why?</B><A NAME="i_29">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Set server:portbase to 0, or remove the line. The HTTP port is at
portbase+80, and the FTP port at portbase+21.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>30: Why does 'http://address/directory' does not work?</B><A NAME="i_30">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This should work. Set server:debug to 1 and see what's going on in
debug.log. If you're on a PPP connection try setting server:translate to 0.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>31: My images don't load, and various links give 'Not found'</B><A NAME="i_31">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can switch off image loading in the browser, but I doubt this is the
problem. More likely, you're using references that are incorrect for the
configuration you're using. Look at the HTML pages, and check the &lt;A
HREF&gt; tags. These must be valid. For example if they refer to some
hostname which is not accessible, the images won't load.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>32: Why do my aliases not work?</B><A NAME="i_32">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Set server:debug to 1 and see what's going on in debug.log. The WBA pages
provide a 'test' facility where you can type an URL, and Xitami tells you
what disk file it would be translated to.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>33: How can I change the error 404 message in Xitami?</B><A NAME="i_33">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Edit the file errors/text-404.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>34: What's 'Vanilla' Xitami?</B><A NAME="i_34">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is just name for the portable, command-line version of Xitami.
Usually we use this term in contrast to the Windows GUI versions of the web
servers, which provide a graphical control panel for the web server.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>35: Why is Xitami.aut not encoded?</B><A NAME="i_35">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is a temporary situation: we plan to release an update in 1998 that
uses encoded (hashed) passwords for better security. The password file
itself is not accessible to browsers, unless you specify the Xitami root
directory as its webpage directory, which would not really be a good idea.
There are also advantages to plain-text password files: it is simple to
manage these using scripts.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>36: After running a script that modifies defaults.aut, how do I get the same script to restart the server?</B><A NAME="i_36">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You don't need to, since Xitami will automatically reload its config,
including any modified password files, after a timeout that you can set as
required (the server:refresh option).

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>37: Can I use 'home.html' instead of 'default.htm'?</B><A NAME="i_37">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Change the defaults.cfg file server:defaultn options. You can specify
anything you like: begin with 'default1'.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>38: What is defaults.cfg? I can't find it anywhere!</B><A NAME="i_38">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Up to v1.3a, people had to modify the pre-supplied xitami.cfg file. This
worked fine until they installed a new version, at which point they could
start again. Defaults.cfg is not supplied with the server - you just copy
the part of xitami.cfg you want to modify. Eg.
<PRE>[CGI]
    debug=1
</PRE>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>39: Why does my webmask (!xx.xx.*) not work?</B><A NAME="i_39">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The webmask is a bit pedantic. This mask forbids all hosts in a certain
domain, but does not <I>allow</I> other hosts. Follow it by ',*' to allow
all other hosts: webmask=!xx.xx.*,*

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>40: How do I make my server run faster?</B><A NAME="i_40">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Make sure the server:keep-alive option is enabled. Add lots of RAM to
your system and make sure this is available to your operating system disk
cache. Put your web site onto a RAM disk.  Don't use lazy, slow CGIs,
especially ones that search large databases. Change the priority under
Windows NT to 'High'.  Raise the keep alive limit to 100 or more under
Windows NT, or Unix (not under Win95 or your system will have problems).

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>41: How do I make my server secure?</B><A NAME="i_41">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Firstly, consider buying Xitami/Pro which includes support for SSL/2,
SSL/3, and TLS.
<P>Then, understand that there are several standard ways to compromise a
system via a web server:
<UL>
<LI>protocol attacks at the TCP/IP level, mostly aimed at denial of service
attacks.  This depends on your operating system.
<LI>buffer-overflow attacks enabled by programming flaws which allow hackers
to write into the server code by using (for instance) very long URLs or
filenames.  Xitami is robust against these attacks.
<LI>all kinds of attacks based on CGI access.  This depends on who you allow
to put CGIs on your web server system.
</UL>
<P>The main protection is to run Xitami on a system that has no basic
security problems (i.e. Linux v.s NT), and to run it under a user id that
has minimum privileges (so that even through a buffer-overflow attack, the
hacker cannot do much damage). Disabling CGI is also a good idea. FTP does
not pose much risk either way, if you disallow uploading, which allows a DoS
attack (fill-up the hard disk).
<P>Here is Brian Westric's checklist for securing Xitami under Windows NT:
<OL>
<LI>Under Unix, set port to 8085 to allow use of guest account (note: this
doesn't work from web admin, one must edit the config file and restart the
server).
<LI>Start webserver as a service that uses a guest account. This account
will have read access to the webpage directories, and no access to other
directories.
<LI>Make sure cgi-bin directory is empty.
<LI>Disable directory browsing (in both cgi, and security sections).
<LI>Delete default user in default.aut.
<LI>Change admin password (by editing default.aut), and specify a su
password (in security tab).
<LI>Ftp: put port (offset) at -7984 so it runs at port 21 (otherwise, it
doesn't seem to work correctly, possibly an issue with my firewall).
<LI>Ftp: rename greeting, goodbye, userpermission, and dirpermission files.
<LI>Ftp: only have an anonymous user, and give them download permission in
one dir, upload in another.
<LI>Ftp: specify log directory for a different directory than main
directory.
</OL>

<P><B>42: I want each user to have FTP access to their personal web pages</B><A NAME="i_42">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You do not need aliases.  Simply assign each user a subdirectory of
the webpages directory, then specify this directory as their FTP home
directory (using a full path).
<P>You can also do it using aliases: create HTTP aliases which point into
the FTP space.  So, user Joe gets a FTP directory: 'ftproot/joe'.  Then
define a HTTP alias:
<PRE>[Aliases]
    joe=ftproot/joe
</PRE>
Which points all URLs starting with '/joe' into this directory.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>43: Does Xitami support http://ipaddress/~username?</B><A NAME="i_43">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The ~username syntax is a UNIX thing; the UNIX shell translates ~username
into the home directory for a user. Xitami does not yet support this
automatically. However you can get much the same effect by creating a
subdirectory for each user underneath the webpages directory, called
'~username'.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>44: In FTP, 'ls' fails from a remote system (it works locally)</B><A NAME="i_44">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is probably due to the remote machine being hidden by a router or
firewall which prevents return connections from the FTP server to the
client. You should use passive mode for such connections. The next release
of Xitami handles this situation better, but the basic problem is
unsolvable; if the client is behind a firewall or router that does not allow
reverse connections (i.e. server to client) then the default FTP protocol
does not work correctly.

<P><B>45: No-one can get to my server. I can get in, but no-one else can</B><A NAME="i_45">&nbsp;</A>
<P>From Paul S R Chisholm and others...
<P>The 'ping' command (from the client to the server) is the simplest way
to make sure that there is a TCP/IP connection actually established.
However, because of "ping of death" attacks that have become popular over
the past year or so, a lot of routers have been shutting off ICMP. Thus,
ping doesn't work. traceroute (a.k.a. tracert) doesn't work either. This
last one really hurts, in my experience. There are other things to try:
<UL>
<LI>"telnet <hostname> 80", then type "HEAD /" <return><return>;
"Connection refused" means the host is accessible but the server isn't
listening (a Bad Thing(tm)).
<LI>"telnet <hostname> 32760"; you *should* get a "Connection refused"
(I presume nothing's listening on port 32760), which means the host is
accessible (a Good Thing(tm)).
</UL>
<P>You can still try ping and traceroute/tracert, but their failure may not
mean anything. (Their *success* is encouraging.)
<P>Another possible problem is that your server is behind a firewall or
proxy server which is preventing HTTP access (it may even allow ping to
work.)  If this is the case, see your network administrator for help.

<P><B>46: No-one can connect to my server through the firewall!</B><A NAME="i_46">&nbsp;</A>
<P>In some networks, your server may not even be addressable from beyond the
firewall. In this case you cannot do much. In other cases, the server is
addressable, but the firewall may be blocking some combination of ports and
protocols and addresses. If this is the case you may be able to convince the
network administrators to open-up access to your server on port 80.

function has no effect on the configuration change you made, you will
need to stop and restart the server program fully.

<P><B>48: The browser is not showing my new pages</B><A NAME="i_48">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There are various reasons why a browser will cache out-of-date pages.
These are the most common ones:
<UL>
<LI>The Reload action by itself will usually fetch pages from the browser
cache, not the web server.  Use Shift+Reload to force the browser to
actually get the page from the server.
<LI>Proxy servers use their own cache.  If your browser connects through a
proxy server, you may find it hard to force a reload.  Disable the proxy
connection, and connect directly to the web server.
<LI>Try flushing the browser disk cache.  It's pointless to flush the
browser's memory cache.
<LI>If you use the META 'expires' tag in the HTML pages, check that it's not
set to a future date.
<LI>If your HTML is generated dynamically (e.g. by a CGI program), check
that HTTP headers such as 'Expires:' and 'Last-Modified:' are correct.  If
in doubt, remove these headers.
</UL>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>49: I get the wrong default page, even if I change the webpages root!</B><A NAME="i_49">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you load a default page, the browser caches it under a URL name with
no filename, e.g. 'http://localhost/'.  If you then switch to another
webpages root and request the same URL, the browser will compare dates and
load the current default page only if it's more recent.  You'll often find
that requesting the full filename will work correctly.  This problem can
occur if you upgrade to a new release of Xitami, then take a look at the
'Welcome to Xitami' default page.  If you then switch to your own config,
the browser won't show your default page.  This problem can also happen if
you run Xitami with different webpage roots, for instance to test different
sites.  The solution to the first case is to flush the browser cache.  In
the second case, disable the server:cache-defaults option.

<P><B>50: I want several 'sites' on the same IP address, on different ports</B><A NAME="i_50">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can run several copies of Xitami, each in a different directory, and
each on a different port.  Xitami is small enough that this will not slow
down the system.  In each directory, create a suitable defaults.cfg file
with the server:portbase set to a different value.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>51: How do I use Xitami on several different web projects?</B><A NAME="i_51">&nbsp;</A>
<P>It's common to use Xitami to test different web projects on the same
system.  Generally we create a suitable root directory with the
defaults.cfg, authorisation, and other site-specific files, then run Xitami
in that directory.  Put the Xitami executable on the path.  You can also run
the Xitami command-line program (For Windows, xidos32.exe) with command-line
options to set the webpages, CGI, and FTP directories (-r, -c, -f).  It's a
good idea to set the server:cache-defaults option to 0 if you use this kind
of setup, so that default pages are always loaded correctly.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>52: How does Xitami work with subdomains?</B><A NAME="i_52">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Let's say you have a domain, like imatix.com, with a fixed IP address
(207.92.100.8 or something like that). The domain-name servers provided by
our web site providers (azc.com), handle the translation from imatix.com to
a numeric address.  For fun, we defined www.imatix.com and ftp.imatix.com to
point to the same address, i.e. the same network card on the same system.
It'd be quite possible to define further subdomains, all ending in
imatix.com, and all pointing to the same system.  We call these 'virtual
hosts' since each apparently distinct system, or host, actually comes back
to the same thing.  Xitami lets you define a specific profile for each
virtual host, which you can create using the WBA virtual host wizard.
All this works under the same single registered domain.

<P><B>1: Xitami does not work - why not?</B><A NAME="3_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You need a TCP/IP winsock.dll.  And it has to work.  And it has to be
configured correctly.  If you have any kind of difficulty running Xitami
or connecting to it, use the PING command to debug your TCP/IP
configuration.  First, use 'ping 127.0.0.1' to check that TCP/IP is
working.  Then, use 'ping localhost' to check that winsock.dll is
working.  Next try ping with the system name that Xitami displays.
Then, try this command from another system.  All these must work before
you can use Xitami.

<P><B>2: 'Could not open HTTP port 80 - Protocol not known'</B><A NAME="3_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Your TCP/IP protocol is not correctly installed.  Ping must work!
This is typically caused by inadequate winsock dialers that have incomplete
support for server applications.  Try Trumpet winsock, which we've been
told works.  Alternatively, install the 16-bit MSIE, which comes with a
TCP/IP stack that should work with Xitami.

<P><B>3: Are there still plans to introduce CGI for Win 3.x?</B><A NAME="3_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>No.  We are moving off this platform in the long term.  You'll find that
the 32-bit console version of Xitami runs pretty well under Win32s, although
CGI does not work due to filesystem incompatibilities.  You <EM>can</EM>
write LRWP programs under Win32s.

<P><B>4: When will FTP work in the Win 3.x version?</B><A NAME="3_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This will never work, due to memory limitations. We've had reasonably
good results running the 32-bit console version on top of Win32s, and we
recommend you try this if you really need the FTP and other features (such
as WBA and LRWP) which are missing from the 16-bit version.

<P><B>5: Why does xiwin16.exe use all my CPU?</B><A NAME="3_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>When idling, xiwin16.exe spends most of its time waiting for incoming
socket events. Under Windows 95 or NT, a 16-bit program that is waiting for
socket events looks like it is sitting on the entire CPU. Maybe it is.
Anything can happen in this business. However, as far as we can tell, the
program really is idling, and does not slow-down the system. If this bothers
you, move to Windows 95, and run the 32-bit version of Xitami. This uses
Windows threads (as well as its own internal multithreading) to reduce CPU
consumption to 1% or less when idling.

<H3><A NAME="TOC123">Windows 95/98 Questions</A></H3>

<P><B>1: Can I use my Win95 system as a real server?</B><A NAME="w_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>A decent web server like Xitami does not need large amounts of memory or
a blazing CPU. You can happily serve a group of several hundred users from a
486 PC with 16Mb memory. If you want to run heavy CGI programs, you'll need
a faster system. Also, a fast hard disk is a good idea. And of course, any
server is limited to the speed of the network. Given a fast hard disk and a
fast network, Xitami will be able to handle several hits per second even on
a slow 486 PC, and dozens of hits per second on a fast Pentium. (One hit per
second is equivalent to about 20 users actively browsing, at the rate of a
page per minute where a page requires about 3 accesses. If an average user
browses for an hour a day, one hit per second thus translates into 100-150
users.) Note that the earlier releases of Win95 are not really too stable.
<P>Note also that Win95 and Win98 appear to be unstable when they are very
heavily loaded; this does not happen with WinNT, and we assume this is done
deliberately, since in principle the TCP/IP code is shared between these
systems (at least the later Win95 releases).  Windows 95/98 leak memory when
the TCP/IP stack is heavily used.  If you want to run a web server on a
small cheap system, use Linux.

<P><B>2: Can I use ASP (Active Server Pages) with Xitami?</B><A NAME="w_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you have Visual Basic 5.0, you can convert your ASP pages with the VB

modifications to the ASP code. You can then compile it as an executable
program, and run it as a normal CGI program.

what programs are using them. Under some Unixes you can use something like
lsof (list open files) to find out the program using them; but I'm not aware
of any equivalent for Windows 95. With Xitami stopped, try running the
netstat command and look for a line with ":80" in it (or ":http") in the
local address part; which indicates that something is using port 80. If
there is, you'll have to dig around and see if you can find what it is.

<P><B>9: Tips for using Xitami with dynamic IP addresses</B><A NAME="w_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>From Alex Feinerg a.k.a Yoonicks@EFNet and others...
<UL>
<LI>Get a DYNAmic Domain. There is a free one: http://www.ml.org: subscribe
to Monolith and register a dynamic domain. You will need to know your ip
every time you reconnect so you can update it.  Under Windows 95/NT, use
winipcfg to see your IP address.
<LI>With Monolith Dynamic IP you can use vhosts.  Just check the button
"Use wild card aliases". All under your-domain.dyn.ml.org will resolve to
your ip. Now use Xitami's vhost feature to perform these tasks so you can run
two sites of one computer.
<LI>Protect yourself with a firewall. Get a windows PC firewall from Conseal
(http://www.signal9.com).  It's not freeware but is very useful.  It blocks
ICMP, UDP and some TCP connections and is configurable.  For Linux/Unix use
ipwadm.
<LI>Does your ISP disconect if you are idle?  If it does write a program that
does a certain task every 10-15 minutes. Here is a script for mirc irc client

<P><B>10: Tips for using a dial-up IP connection</B><A NAME="w_10">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
<LI>Disable dial-on-demand; this option causes the winsock library to try to
connect each time you initialise it. (In MSIE3, choose View, Options,
Connection, and clear the option 'Connect to the Internet as needed'; for
MSIE4, tell it you have a LAN connection, not a modem connection). At the
best, this option will cause you delay and expense when you try to browse
local pages. At the worst it can cause long timeouts while your browser
tries to resolve names.
<LI>If you have an early release of Windows 95, install the dial-up
networking upgrade (last seen somewhere in the vicinity of the MS ISDN
dial-up package).
<LI>Enable Xitami's server:autostart option.  Then you can start Xitami at
boot time, and it'll wait until the dial-up connection is ready.

<P><B>11: Ping will find 127.0.0.1 but not <I>myhost</I>.com</B><A NAME="w_11">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Ping is a good test to see if your computer name can be translated
correctly. If you're on the Internet, you need to ask your Internet service
provider to make the necessary DNS entries. On your own PC, you can edit the
'hosts' file in the Windows directory. The file 'hosts.sam' is a sample that
you can rename to 'hosts'. Then, add your machine name and 127.0.0.1. This
may not always work; address translation may require that you are actually
on-line. For instance, I can 'ping 127.0.0.1' at any time. When I try to
'ping localhost', I get the TCP/IP dial-up dialog. I can Cancel this, and
then 'ping localhost' works. But to ping my machine name, I must be online.

<P><B>12: How do I debug my Windows network connection?</B><A NAME="w_12">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Windows 95 includes two tools besides ping to test TCP/IP connections:
tracerout and winipcfg. With tracert, you can follow the route for a TCP/IP
connection. Open a DOS prompt and type the command: tracert
<I>somehost.com</I>. The program shows the route to the host, up to 30 hops.
Type tracert with no arguments to get help. Winipcfg shows you your IP
address(es) and some more information about your network.  Just type
winipcfg; it's a Windows program.

<PRE>[server]

file to see what error messages Xitami has logged.  If you get a message
like 'Port is already used', check that no other web server is already
running.

<P><B>14: I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on aliases</B><A NAME="w_14">&nbsp;</A>
<P>For security, Xitami does not allow access through short filenames when a
long filename is defined. Without this check, it's possible to bypass
user/password authentication by using the shortened name for a long name, or
vice-versa. When you get this error, the xitami.log file will say '- request
refers to an illegal filename'. One consequence of this security check is
that if you use short filenames in your alias or webpages definition, all
requests through to those files will be rejected with a 403 error (not
authorized). Use the full long filenames in alias or webpages definitions,
or if the security issue does not bother you, set the security:safepaths
option to 0.

<P><B>15: I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on other URLs</B><A NAME="w_15">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There are a number of specific reasons why Xitami may return this:
<OL>
<LI>The resource you are accessing is protected by a 'webmask' definition
which excludes your PC.
<LI>You are trying to browse a directory, but directory listings have not
been enabled.
<LI>You are trying to use an HTTP update method (PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY)
on a resource which has not been authorised for this.
<LI>You are trying to run the WBA, but this has been disabled by the
security:admin option.
<LI>The URL refers to a Windows short filename when a long filename also
exists.  Xitami rejects this as being a potential security violation.
You can switch this behaviour off by setting security:safepaths to 0.
<LI>You're trying to do a HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation, and
specified an absolute Content-Location: or Destination: URI which did not
have the same path as the request URI.  Xitami rejects this because the
authorisation was carried-out on the request URL, and using a different path
for the Content-Location: or Destination: URL would violate this.
<LI>A HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation failed because of an access
violation at the operating system level - for instance Xitami tried to write
to a file which was marked as read-only.
</OL>
<P>In most of these cases, the reason for the error will be logged when you
enable server debugging.

<P><B>19: My 16-bit CGI program does not output anything</B><A NAME="w_19">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You cannot correctly run a 16-bit CGI program that is on a path with
'long filenames'. For instance, if you installed Xitami in 'C:\Program
Files\Xitami', then put a 16-bit CGI into the cgi-bin subdirectory, it will
run, but its output is lost, and the browser will eventually time out and
show a message like 'Document contains no data'. The fix is to either move
Xitami to a directory like 'C:\Xitami' or create a CGI alias and put the CGI
programs elsewhere than under the Xitami root.

<P>The FrontPage server extensions are not documented and as far as we have
been able to test, they do not work with Xitami under UNIX or under Windows
NT.  Support for specific servers appears to be added at the whim of
Microsoft, so you may want to try writing Bill Gates a sweet letter.  We're
not in the business of reverse-engineering Microsoft software.

<P>You probably set the priority to 'High'.  This is excellent if you do not
use the system for anything else, but is not a good idea if Xitami shares
the system with other users.  At high priority, Xitami will consume most of
the CPU time during large downloads.  We do recomment High priority for a
dedicated web server, and 'Normal' for a mixed-use system.

<P>Check that you've not configured your MS-DOS command window to appear
full-screen. When the Xitami web server launches the CGI program, it does so
in a way that says don't create a console window for the application.
However, if the command window agent is configured for full screen, it
switches first to full screen before making the test for putting up a
console window which causes the blank screen to appear (sometimes with a
blinking cursor). There doesn't appear to be a way of preventing this
behaviour programmatically.

<P>Microsoft IE 3.0 has occasional problems mixing keep-alive connections
with highly-framed documents. The symptoms are that the last frames will not
display. IE opens a connection, asks for a document, but prematurely closes
the frame. Workarounds: use Navigator, a more recent version of IE (we
assume the problem may be fixed), or switch-off keep-alive if you are using
heavily-framed documents.

this technique to launch a browser when you click on the 'Setup' button. You
can either try installing TCP/IP networking (again) or start a browser and
enter the URL 'http://127.0.0.1/admin' yourself.  This file may only be on

headers, listserver, logging, error reporting, ...). It runs with Windows 95
and it's very fast. Now, I'm using Xitami and VPOP3 together - both programs
are working very well in my local network.
<P>Justin Scott says: Try the freeware version of SLMail .. it supports
upto 6 users, and an autoresponder. It's a commercial-grade e-mail server
for Win95/NT. If you want more than the 6 users available in the freeware
version, you'll have to get the standard edition for win95 (SLMail v2.6),
which runs for about $200 (go with the freeware). It is available from
Seattle Labs at www.seattlelab.com. Hope you find it useful (I know I do :).
<P>Ian Hayes says: For Win95/NT you can get a nice little SMTP server called
JSMail at http://j-bg.demon.co.uk It does SMTP, POP3, finger, autoresponders
and you can reject mail based on Received: lines, source or subject words.
Reverse DNS, anti-relay, and RBL support (for those interested). Of course,
you'll still need a domain, and when mailing to certian domains, an MX
record. Monolith provides both for free. You can run it as a service or from
the command line. Takes up very little resources.

<P><B>39: Any hints for boosting Xitami's performance?</B><A NAME="w_39">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
<LI>Set virtual memory yourself.  If Windows handles this, the swap file
changes constantly, thus slowing your system.  You should set both the
min/max virtual memory to 1 1/2 to 3 times the physical memory in your
computer.
<LI>Create a RAM disk for Perl if you use a lot of CGIs. A RAM disk is fast,
and reloaded at boot time. You should use RAM disks for read-only data only.
To put Perl onto a RAM disk, use a disk with 512-byte sectors and about 1.2
Mb space. Use a line like this in config.sys:
<PRE>DEVICEHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1200 512 /E
</PRE>
where 1200 is the size and 512 is the sector size. Windows will attach the
next available free drive letter to it (e.g. 'R:'). If you want to load Perl
onto the RAM disk automatically, at boot time, add some commands to your
autoexec.bat:
<PRE>md r:\perl
xcopy32 e:\perl\bin\perl*.* r:\perl
xcopy32 e:\perl\bin\cmd*.* r:\perl
PATH %PATH%;R:\PERL
set PERLLIB=E:\PERL\LIB
</PRE>
This assumes that you leave the Perl libraries on the hard disk (here, E:).
If you want a full-blown Perl on a RAM disk, you'll need about 6Mb of space.
<LI>Create a RAM disk for commonly-used web pages and graphics.
<LI>In the Win95 System control panel, under Performance, File System, set
the 'Typical Role' to 'Network Server'.  We have reports that this improves
system performance under heavy loads.

<P><B>40: Why does Win95 insist on running 'service.bat'?</B><A NAME="w_40">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami installs this batch file when you install the Xitami Console
version as a Windows 95 service. The service.bat file simply sets the
correct working directory, then starts Xitami. To disable this, you can edit
service.bat to remove the call to xidos32.exe. You can also remove the entry
for service.bat in the registry; run regedit and find the key
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices. You'll see a
definition for service.bat, which you can delete.

<P>Okay, but be warned that this opens your system to arbitrary abuse. You
cannot launch a Windows program directly, since a CGI program runs as a
hidden console (DOS) process. However, it's trivial via a small batch file,
which itself starts the Windows program. For instance, here's a batch file
that starts any program at all using the CGI argument, e.g.
"/cgi-bin/run?notepad", where run.bat contains just 3 characters: "@%1".

<P>Yes, this is a good way to run the console version as a service. You can

Microsoft Developer Network web site).  The following tips were provided by
Ignacio "Iggie" Bustamante.
<OL>
<LI>Copy SRVANY.EXE and INSTSRV.EXE to your NT system directory and install
it as a Windows NT service for Xitami, for example:
<PRE>instsrv Xitamiweb c:\winnt\System32\srvany.exe
</PRE>
This will set the preliminary entries for a service named "Xitami" (choose
your own name).
<LI>Specify the application to start and its parameters:
  <UL>
    <LI>Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT32.EXE), and open the registry at
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Xitamiweb.
    <LI>Create a "DependOnService' value of type REG_MULTI_SZ and specify
    the services that should be started before launching Xitami; mamely, Tcpi
    and Afd. For example:
    <PRE>DependOnService: REG_MULTI_SZ Tcpip Afd</PRE>
    You will be presented with a multi-entry screen.  Just hit [Enter] after
    each entry.  You can add other services here if you wish.
    <LI>Create a 'Parameters' key.  Under the Parameters key, create an
    'Application' value of type REG_SZ and specify the full path of the Xitami
    executable (including the extension), for example:
    <PRE>Application: REG_SZ: C:\Xitami\Xiwin32.exe</PRE>
    <LI>Additionally, under the Parameters key, create an 'AppDirectory' value
    of type REG_SZ and specify the current directory to use for Xitami, for
    example:
    <PRE>AppDirectory: REG_SZ: C:\Xitami</PRE>
  </UL>
<LI>Under Settings-> Control Panel-> Services, select Startup for Xitami.
Set Startup Type:  "Automatic", set Log On As: Select "This Account", and
enter the appropiate Username and Password for an Administrative account.
</OL>
This should do it.  Note that NT will report that the service was started
successfully even if there was an error.  Always test Xitami after changing
its configuration by running it as a console program (with the service
stopped).  When the service has started, test the server and check its log
files for possible errors.

<H3><A NAME="TOC125">UNIX Questions</A></H3>

<P><B>1: Xitami does not build on my XXXX system</B><A NAME="u_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami should build on: IBM AIX, Digital UNIX, HP/UX, Sun Solaris, SCO
OpenUNIX, SCO OpenServer, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Sinix, and of course Linux.
Anything else is unexplored territory, and that includes the future, since
some of these systems are starting to come without an ANSI C compiler as
standard.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: I need to search /usr/src/linux/include/ at build time</B><A NAME="u_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The Xitami build uses a script, 'c', that lets you specify additional
compiler options by setting the CCDEFINES variable. So, to specify an
additional include directory, use shell commands like this before starting
xibuild:
<PRE># CCDEFINES="-I/usr/src/linux/include"
# export CCDEFINES
# ./xibuild
</PRE>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>3: Can I run Xitami from my ISP telnet account?</B><A NAME="u_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes, if you have access to an ANSI C compiler. Build Xitami as usual, and
run it with a command like this: 'xitami -b 5000 -s'. Avoid port 8080 which
is often used for proxies. You may also find that the ISP kill all
long-running processes at regular intervals (e.g. midnight). The -s switch
runs Xitami in the background; it's a bit cleaner than using 'nohup'.

<P><B>4: Does Xitami support .htaccess with per-directory access control?</B><A NAME="u_4">&nbsp;</A>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>5: How can I run Xitami and have it listen on port 80 under Unix?</B><A NAME="u_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Under Unix, only processes that are running as root are able to listen
for new connections to TCP/IP ports less than 1024, including the well
known HTTP port 80.  So for Xitami to listen for connections on port 80
it needs to be run as root.  And of course there must not be another web
server running that is already listening for connections to port 80.
There are three ways that you could do this:
<OL>
<LI>Log in, or su, to root, and start up Xitami.
<LI>Have Xitami started during the startup scripts when the machine boots.
<LI>Make Xitami "setuid root".
</OL>
Which is best?  It depends.  (In the real world the answer is always "it
depends"; why do they never accept that in exams?)
<UL>
<LI>If you just want to run Xitami occassionally on your own system then
starting it up manually by logging in as root, or su'ing to root, is the
best idea, because it ensures only people with the root password can run
programs as root.
<LI>If you want Xitami running all the time on your Unix system then having
it started automatically from the boot scripts is best, and by default
it will then start running as root, letting it listen on port 80.
Exactly how to set this up varies from Unix system to Unix system, so
look in the documentation for your Unix system.
<LI>If your Unix system is only used by you, or just by people that you
trust, and you don't want Xitami running all the time, and you don't
want people to log in (or su) to root, then setting Xitami "setuid root"
might be a suitable option for you.
</UL>
To make Xitami "setuid root" after compiling it:
<PRE>% su
# chown root xitami
# chgrp www xitami
# chmod 4770 xitami
# exit
%
</PRE>
where "www" is a Unix group that contains the users that should be able to
start Xitami. Then the users that can run Xitami will be able to start it
running as root, just by running it.  If you do decide to set Xitami "setuid
root" beware that this is a potiental security risk, because it means that
users without the root password can start the server running, and if they
discover a bug in Xitami or a program run by Xitami they may be able to get
root access to other things on the machine.
<P>iMatix does not recommend setting Xitami "setuid root" except in
situations where only people who can be trusted to run any program as root
have access to log in to the machine, such as a personal Unix box. Even in
this situation the use of a program like "sudo" should be investigated as a
possible alternative.  Please also take a look at the next question
concerning security aspects.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>6: What are the security implications of running Xitami as root?</B><A NAME="u_6">&nbsp;</A>
<P>From Xitami 2.4b onwards it has been possible to request Xitami to change
to a different user id and group id from the one that it was started in, for
most of the time it is running.  To do this in the [Security] section of
defaults.cfg put:
<PRE>[Security]
    setuid=1
    setuid-user=www
    setuid-group=www
</PRE>
assuming you have a "www" user and a "www" group (this is a common setup for
Web Servers, but not universal). The default for setuid-user is "nobody" and
the default for setuid-group is "nogroup", but using "www" for user and
group is better if you have them available (or can add them).  The user and
group privileges you choose will have to be sufficient to allow Xitami to
write to all the log files it needs, and run the programs it needs (eg,
cgi-bin programs).
<P>When [Security] setuid=1 is used Xitami changes the effective user id and
group id to the ones specified. However it also retains the privileges with
which it was started (commonly in this situation root privileges), in order
to be able to reopen the TCP/IP port it is listening on and so on.
<P>Currently Xitami runs cgi-bin programs with the same privileges as it is
running itself.  This means that when [security] setuid=1 is used, cgi-bin
programs will be started with the effective user and group set as
configured in the [security] section, but still with the user id with
which it was started saved away (typically the "root" user id).
<P>If Xitami is started as root (or has been "setuid root" (see above)),
and using [security] setuid=1 a malicious cgi-bin program could recover
the saved root privileges and then do nasty things.  It also means that
if someone finds an exploitable bug in your cgi-bin program, they might
be able to trick the program into recovering the root privileges and
running a program as root.  All of this means that, as always, you need
to be especially careful about checking cgi-bin programs for security
issues.
<P>Work is under way adding the ability for Xitami to run cgi-bin programs
with different privileges from the ones which it is running as, including
permanently discarding any saved privileges, which will further reduce this
risk. This enhanced version will also include the ability to run the cgi-bin
program with a different "root directory" from the one that Xitami is using,
for additional security.

<P><B>7: What's the best Linux operating system? RedHat, Debian, FreeBSD...?</B><A NAME="u_7">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Ewen McNeill says: Firstly, FreeBSD isn't a Linux operating system; it's
a BSD-derived operating system. I haven't used it myself, but a number of
large sites do use it and seem to be quite happy with it (eg, cdrom.com).
Earlier versions of Xitami compiled and run under FreeBSD, but I'm not sure
if anyone has tried with recent versions -- it should either run or be
pretty simple to fix so it'll run.
<P>Of the rest (RedHat, Debian, OpenLinux) I wouldn't expect much difference
between them in terms of ability to handle load, etc. (Same for Slackware,
Suse, etc as well.) They're all based around the same Linux kernels, and
that (along with the web server) are the main things that'll affect
stability, speed, etc (given the same hardware).
<P>The main reason for choosing between the difference Linux distributions
is the packaging of software they give you. Both RedHat (which uses RPM) and
Debian (which uses .deb packages) have flexible package managers which will
let you automatically install pre-compiled software, and make sure that any
other programs that are needed to use them get installed too. RedHat has
more GUI administration tools, but I've heard that it's more fussy about you
using them too (that is, editing files by hand doesn't work so wel). Debian
mostly has command line admin tools, which is good if you're used to that
sort of thing (I like it). OpenLinux, Suse, etc, I don't know that much
about -- but Suse is apparently very popular in Europe, and LinuxJournal are
offering a copy of it with new subscriptions at present (at least they were
in July). (I've installed some Slackware systems in the past and having
tried Debian wouldn't switch back. Slackware seems to handle the basic
install okay, but it's not so good on helping you keep your system up to
date; Debian is very good at helping you keep your system up to date.
<P>Personally my systems are all Debian systems -- but I like the command
line tools, and the (dpkg) package manager, and tend to install systems
without X.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>8: Why does the documentation always use DOS-style slashes?</B><A NAME="u_8">&nbsp;</A>
<P> All recent versions of Xitami treat \ and / as identical, so the
distinction is purely for the benefit of the server administrator. (Actually
there is one exception, which is the \\ used to identify a remote file
system under Windows. This must be entered as \\, not //.) We generally aim
the documentation at Windows users, since these make-up the large majority
of our user base. We also expect that Unix users are able to make the mental
translation from \ to /.  Use / on Unix and either / or \ on Windows.

<P><B>1: Xitami does not start, and 'ping 127.0.0.1' does not work</B><A NAME="o_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Check the interfaces and routing with "netstat -r"; a "127.0.0.1"
host with the interf(ace) of "lo" ought to be present if it is going
to work.  The following command ought to establish a loopback

<P><B>3: Xitami aborts when my site is very heavily used</B><A NAME="o_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>EMX appears to have a fixed limit of 40 open sockets; when you hit this,
programs start to abort or freeze. It's very unusual to reach 40 open
sockets, but it is possible. You can limit the number of HTTP and FTP
connections for your server, remembering that each FTP connection uses two
sockets (one control, one data). You should also allow 5 sockets for use by
Xitami itself.

<H3><A NAME="TOC127">Application Programming Questions</A></H3>

<P><B>1: How do I write CGIs?</B><A NAME="c_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There must be hundreds of places to get a good answer to this question.
Look at the example programs in the cgi-src directory.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: What's a good source for CGI programs?</B><A NAME="c_2">&nbsp;</A>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>3: When I run a CGI program, I don't get any response</B><A NAME="c_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Run your CGI in a DOS box and check first that it actually runs without
errors.  Then, check that whether it prints a first line starting with
'HTTP/'.  If it does this, it must also generate a correct 'Content-Length'
header.  This is vital if the server uses Keep-Alive connections, which is
the default configuration.  You can disable Keep-Alive, but this makes
things work slower.  The best solution is to <I>not</I> produce neither the
'HTTP/' first line, nor the 'Content-Length' line.  These just cause
problems.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>4: Does Xitami have an API like ISAPI or NSAPI?</B><A NAME="c_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>We support WSX and LRWP.  These are portable protocols: WSX lets you
build plugins that are linked into the server; LRWP lets you build external
peer processes that handle specific URLs.  WSX programs are written using
the iMatix SMT library, in C.  LRWP programs can be written in C, Java,
Python, Perl, or any other language that supports sockets.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>5: Would you recommend CGI or WSX for a simple e-mail application?</B><A NAME="c_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>CGI is much simpler.  There is lots of information about CGI on the Net.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>6: How do I tell Xitami which files are CGI programs?</B><A NAME="c_6">&nbsp;</A>
<P>With some servers you have to configure the server to recognise executable
files.  For instance with Apache, one uses the AddHandler directive to say
that a filename extension should be treated as a CGI script.  For example
"AddHandler cgi-script .cgi".
<P>Xitami, in contrast, will execute anything it considers executable and
which is in a CGI binary directory. Special directives are not needed. Under
Windows, files with extension .exe or .com or .bat are executable by
default. Otherwise, files that start with #! and the name of an interpreter
are executable through the interpreter (typical example: Perl scripts).
Otherwise, files starting with the magic letters 'MZ' are also considered to
be executable. Under Unix, executable files are de-facto marked by a
protection bit, which makes things a lot simpler.
<P>You can add support for special kinds of CGIs by using the [Filter]
configuration section: this allows you to execute a file by passing it to
some interpreter.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>7: How do I debug CGI programs?</B><A NAME="c_7">&nbsp;</A>
<P>In many cases you can run the CGI program from the command-line,
providing test data to the program using the '<' redirector. It's also
possible to use a debugger. For example, under Windows I use the MSVC
compiler for C CGI programs. To set a debug breakpoint I insert a call to
DebugBreak() at some appropriate point in the program. This launches the
debugger and I can then step through the code. If you use this technique, be
sure to set the cgi:timeout high enough so that Xitami does not think your
CGI program has started to loop (it will then kill the process, and leave
you with a very confused debugger).

<LI>This applies to Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98.
<LI>Get Perl for Windows from <A href="http://www.activestate.com/">activestate.com</A>.
<LI>Follow the installation instructions and install into a directory like
C:\software\perl.
<LI>Using the above example, make sure that the PATH setting in your
autoexec.bat includes the directory C:\software\perl\bin.
<LI>Also, make sure that the PERLLIB environment variable is set in your
autoexec.bat to 'PERLLIB=.;C:\software\perl\lib'.
<LI>Reboot, then go to the Xitami cgi-bin directory and try 'perl
testperl.pl'.  This should print 'Hello World'.
<LI>Now make sure that the CGI scripts you want to run start with the magic
line '#! perl', or '#! /usr/bin/perl' or '#! C:/Software/perl/bin/perl' or
something else appropriate.

<P><B>9: Why does my Perl CGI not run?</B><A NAME="c_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is a check list that may help you.
<OL>
<LI>Did you install Perl?  (Yes, some people do forget this.)
<LI>Can you run the CGI script from the DOS command line using the syntax
'perl <I>scriptname</I>'?
<LI>Can you run the standard http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi program?
<LI>Can you run a simple script like this:
<PRE>#! perl
print "Hello World!";
</PRE>
<LI>Does your CGI script start with '#! perl'?
<LI>If you're running a 16-bit Perl, make sure Xitami is not in a subdirectory
with long filenames (E.g. C:\Program Files\Xitami) or the CGI won't work.
Under NT, forget 16-bit Perls completely.
<LI>Finally, set the cgi:debug and server:debug options to 1. This will
leave you with a couple of files in the temp directory- tempxxxx.cgo and
header.log - that contain the actual CGI output and the headers sent back to
the browser.

<P><B>13: When I try to run a Perl CGI, my browser says 'Save to disk?'</B><A NAME="c_13">&nbsp;</A>

<P><B>14: A require() or use() command in my Perl CGI script fails</B><A NAME="c_14">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is a problem caused by the working directory used by the Perl
interpreter.  First-off, make sure the CGI working directory is "-" (which
means the script's current working directory).  If this still does not work,
you have to modify the CGI script to explicitly set the correct working
directory.  Issue the following command, once, near the beginning of the
main Perl function and be any "require()" or "use()" commands:
<PRE>chdir ("c:/Xitami/cgi-bin/my_perl_script_dir");

<P>Use an absolute path, and substitute your own path, of course.

<P>You have probably a problem with the PERLLIB setting.  It must include
the directories where require'd files are found.  Alternatively, you may be
able to fix this by running the script in the correct directory (set the CGI
workdir to "-").  To sort this problem out, make a CGI script that creates a
small file, then look for the file (this tells you where the script is
running).  E.g.:
<PRE>open (FILE, ">myhint");
print FILE "This is my working directory";
close (FILE);

in turn means there was a bug in your script.  Two things that might help:
<OL>
<LI> If you're using CGI.pm (recommended for Perl CGI scripts) then try
running it from the command line (CGI.pm will prompt for the script input,
which is very handy).
<LI>When you've run the CGI script, have a look in the Xitami cgi error log,
which is cgierr.log by default. If your script fails to compile, then you'll
get error messages here.
</OL>
You can also try putting "warn" messages in your Perl script, eg:
<PRE>warn "About to try ... \n";
</PRE>
and they'll appear in the CGI error log, so long as the script compiles and
runs up to that line.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>17: How does Xitami handle its CGI stdio?</B><A NAME="c_17">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami creates temporary files called 'pipe' something, and connects
these to the stdin and stdout streams for the CGI subprocess. If there is
something crooked in the subprocess itself, these can get lost. For instance
if it's a 16-bit program under NT. The CGI_STDIN and CGI_STDOUT environment
variables are provided for languages like BASIC which really can't access
the stdio. Then it's possible to switch-off Xitami's piping (set cgi:stdio
to 0), and in the program, read and write the stdin and stdout files
directly.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>18: Why does my Perl 'flush' command not work under Xitami?</B><A NAME="c_18">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This command is a simple "$| = 1;" issued somewhere at the beginning of
the script, and is supposed to send (flush) to the browser any and all
output (print statements) as they are being issued. Because Xitami does not
work with streaming output, for now. It buffers all CGI output until the CGI
ends, then sends it to the browser. We're considering alternatives to this
model to allow streaming output.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>19: My BASIC .exe CGI does not work</B><A NAME="c_19">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Some languages do not write their output to the stdout device, but
directly to the BIOS. Try 'myprog > xxx' and if the output is still being
sent to the screen, consult your documentation. At a pinch, use the
CGI_STDOUT environment variable to determine the name of the expected output
file, and write directly to that file. If you do this, makes sure you set
cgi:stdio to 0.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>20: Why do I get 'HTTP/1.0 502: Service temporarily overloaded'?</B><A NAME="c_20">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Increase the cgi:timeout value. Your CGI is taking so long that Xitami
reckons it's looping with intent, and kills it (after giving it the
customary fair trial, of course). ('Looping with intent' is a Legal Term
that means almost exactly, but not quite totally, the opposite.)

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>21: Why is the REMOTE_USER not correctly filled-in?</B><A NAME="c_21">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Make sure your directory is password-protected.  You can put the CGI
script at any level under a directory like 'private', so long as the URL
contains '/cgi-bin' somewhere.  If you access a CGI without an
authentication check, the REMOTE_USER will contain arbitrary junk; typically
the last user id that was used to access a protected resource.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>22: Why is the HTTP_REFERER not correctly filled-in?</B><A NAME="c_22">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Variables starting with HTTP_ come from the browser (unless you changed
something you were not supposed to).  For instance, the browser will usually
provide its own name rank and serial number in 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'.
HTTP_REFERER is filled-in if you choose a URL from another page, but not if
you type it by hand.

<P>There is no equivalent to the UNIX 'chmod' command under DOS/Windows.
After considering various techniques (e.g. looking at the extension), we
decided that the UNIX execve technique was the simplest; i.e. the script
specifies what interpreter to use. Actually if you want to see the code that
decides this, look at the SFL code in sflfile.c -- file_is_executable ().
The UNIX technique works for Perl, Awk and presumably shell scripts, and
with a little tweaking, for Rexx too. Finally, we take a peek at the file
contents if necessary. Under MS-DOS & Windows, a real executable starts with
'MZ'. That's sufficient for Xitami to try to run the thing. Conclusion:
executable files can take any extension and work with pretty much any
processor/interpreter.

validated) and return a header that redirects the browser to the actual
page: "Location: /somedir/somefile.htm". Use the environment variable
REMOTE_USER, which contains the user id.

<P><B>36: How do I write a shopping-card CGI program?</B><A NAME="c_36">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You should ask this kind of question on CGI or HTTP newsgroups, and
research the Internet for answers. The simplest way to do this is to use
cookies, or to use URL arguments (?xxxx) to know the 'state' for each user.
If you want to maintain long-term state for users, it's best to force them
to logon (and thus identify themselves) each time they come back to the
site.  See the question on <A href="index13.htm#user_authentication">CGI user authentication</A>.

<P><B>37: How do I access ODBC databases under Windows?</B><A NAME="c_37">&nbsp;</A>
<P>From Perl, you can use Win32::ODBC, ActivePerl for Win95, and the DCOM
driver. One report: "It worked very well - I was able to duplicate in a
matter of hours what my buddy took almost a week to do with MS software, and
the result was faster and looks better!"

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>38: My CGI program can't connect to ODBC under Windows NT; it works from the command line</B><A NAME="c_38">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Under NT, each login ID has its own set of ODBC definitions. The reason
your program works from the command line is that it runs under your current
login ID, which apparently has a proper ODBC definition to utilize. The
Xitami web server runs as an NT service and does not use your login ID by
default. Xitami and all CGI programs launched from within it assume the
login ID assigned to Xitami at start up. This can either be a system ID,
which is typical, or a specified user ID, which requires extra configuration
by an NT administrator.
<P>The solution is to have an NT login created specifically for Xitami. It
need only have the standard User privileges (assuming your NT environment
uses the default definition of "User"). After this login is established, one
must use it to login and then define a proper ODBC connection. Next, Xitami
must be made to start as NT service using this new login instead of a system
ID. Since this new login ID does not (or at least should not) have
administrative rights, one will have to logout and log back in as an
administrator to change this setting, which is made from the Services
component of the Control Panel. Now when CGI programs run, they will do so
under the new login ID, and will consequently have access to the new ODBC
definition.

<P><B>39: When I run a heavy ODBC CGI program, I get "Server Overloaded"</B><A NAME="c_39">&nbsp;</A>

<P><B>40: My images don't load when my CGI uses extra PATH_INFO</B><A NAME="c_40">&nbsp;</A>
<P>When you run a CGI that contains extra path information (the PATH_INFO
environment variable), images on pages generated by the CGI will fail to
load if they're referred-to by relative URLs.  For example, if the CGI URL
is http://my_domain/cgi-bin/my_prog.cgi/extra-blah, and you refer to an
image "pic.gif", the browser will ask for a URL called:
http://my_domain/cgi-bin/my_prog.cgi/extra-blah/pic.gif, which presumably
won't work.  You can check this by enabling server debugging and looking at
debug.log.  There are two solutions:
<OL>
<LI>Use absolute references for the image files (starting with '/').
<LI>Add a BASE tag at the start of the page (after the HEAD tag):
<PRE>&lt;BASE href="http://my-domain/cgi-bin/"&gt;

<P><B>41: How do I do file uploads through CGI?</B><A NAME="c_41">&nbsp;</A>

File to process: &lt;INPUT NAME="userfile1" TYPE="file"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</PRE>
You can test this quite simply by using ACTION="cgi-bin/testcgi.exe" and
enabling CGI debugging ([cgi]debug=1) to see what the stdin stream looks
like. To decode the file upload data you could use the functions in
sflhttp.c.
<P>Form-based file uploads do not work in IE3.x and earlier, and we have
reports that it fails with some IE4 configurations.  Netscape 3.x and later
work fine.  Opera 3.x does not handle this.  Therefore, we recommend that
you use this carefully and probably best within an intranet setting where
you can be sure of the type and version of browser used.

<P><B>43: Can I use Java servlets with Xitami?</B><A NAME="c_43">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Takyiu Liu says: I have used servlets with Xitami with an unconventional
way. I use servletrunner (or Jrun if you prefer a 3rd party servlet engine)
and point it to the servlet classes I have written (I have the servlet
connected to a SQL Anywhere DB on request). I then use Xitami to serve the
web pages, with form actions pointing at something like:
<PRE>&lt;FORM ACTION="http://53pc2951:8000/servlet/DBQuery" METHOD="POST"&gt;
</PRE>
On any platform where the servletrunner is not available, one can use the
(undocumented) approach:
<PRE>java sun.servlet.http.HttpServer -d your_servlet_directory
</PRE>
In other words, so long as a platform has a JDK 1.1 JVM, you can run servlets
with just a copy of jsdk.jar.
<P>Jrun is meant to be a servlet engine but in 2.2 they added primitive http
support.  By default, it comes up on port 8000 and a typical location to put
the web pages is:
<PRE>\Program Files\Live Software\JRun\2.2\jsm-default\services\jws\htdocs
</PRE>
I think it is modelled after Sun's Java Web Server.  The default path for the
servlet classes is:
<PRE>\Program Files\Live Software\JRun\2.2\jsm-default\services\jse\servlets.
</PRE>I also believe Jrun's http capability comes from ACME's server API, and
so is very primitive compared with Xitami.  It is great to be able to combine
Xitami's http capability and Jrun (or servletrunner)'s servlet capability.

<P>This is a problem with some Unix systems, caused by a limit on the number
of open file handles. You can link Xitami with AT&T's "SFIO" library
(available from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/sfio/ ). No source
modification is required: just copy libstdio.a and libsfio.a from the SFIO
distribution to ./src/smt/ and modify one line in "./src/smt/c" script from:

<P>When a browser requests a page which Xitami considers 'protected', i.e.
which is defined in defaults.aut, it fills-in a request header like like
this:
<PRE>Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6MTIzNDU2Nzg=
</PRE>
<P>The strange thing at the end is the sequence "username:password" encoded
using base-64, as defined in the Basic Authentication Scheme in RFC2068.
Xitami provides the encoded string in the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION environment
variable.  You can decode this using a fairly simple function - see the SFL
sflmime module for an example in C.
<P>It's also possible to tell the browser to ask for a password, if none is
supplied, by generating a WWW-authenticate header.  For example:
<PRE>  if not VariableSet( HTTP_AUTHORIZATION )
    {
     HeaderLine( 'HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized' );
     HeaderLine( 'WWW-authenticate: basic realm="UserArea"' );
     echo 'Text to send if user hits Cancel button';
     exit;
    }
  else
     HeaderLine( 'Location: http://anHost/users/userCode/userPage.html' );

<P><B>1: What exactly do I need to define for a Virtual Host?</B><A NAME="v_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>For the main configuration you have xitami.cfg+defaults.cfg. For each
virtual host you have some XXXXX.cfg. For unresolved virtual hosts you have
basehost.cfg. Use the WBA virtual host wizard to define new virtual hosts.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: How do I set-up a virtual host on another port?</B><A NAME="v_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can do this quite simply by starting two copies of Xitami. We do this
quite often; the advantage is that you can get the effect of multiple hosts
(different document roots) without playing with the DNS system. Otherwise,
you have to define DNS entries that map several different names
'www1.here.com', 'www2.here.com' to the same IP address, then base the
virtual hosting on the different names. Either way is okay; Xitami is so
small that running two or even a dozen copies will not stress a system.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>3: How do I provide space for individual users on my system?</B><A NAME="v_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Let's say you installed Xitami in c:\servers\xitami. Then, the main
webpage directory will be c:\servers\xitami\webpages. An URL like
'http://dynamic210.adelphia.net/Joe' is taken to mean something like:
'http://dynamic210.adelphia.net/Joe/index.htm', which would be a file:
'c:\servers\xitami\webpages\joe\index.htm'. You can also use
default.htm, and you can change the main webpages directory to be
somewhere else if you want. Under Windows 95 and NT you can make each
subdirectory shareable separately, so that users can update their pages
but not mess with other files.  You can also use aliases, especially if
users' pages are on different disks.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>4: And how about their CGI scripts?</B><A NAME="v_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Any URL containing /cgi-bin/ is treated as a CGI directory. So, Joe

<P>It should work okay, providing you stop the two Xitami's from stepping on
each others toes (eg, different home directories). If you want to run on
port 1010 you'll have to give Xitami a carefully calculated base value (base
(1010-80)=930; 1080 would be easier (base 1000).

<P><B>6: My virtual host setup does not work - what can I try?</B><A NAME="v_6">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
<LI>First off, if you're using DNS-based virtual hosting, understand that
this will only work with version 3 or later browsers.  If in doubt, enable
server debugging and check the request.log - each request must have the
correct Host: header field.
<LI>Then, check the debug.log file, which will show the virtual-host chosen
for each URL request.
<LI>If necessary, use the config-file debugging option to trace which config
files are loaded, and when.  Any line starting with '!' will be sent to the
debug.log file, if debugging is enabled.  For instance, add lines like this
to your VH config and authorisation files:
<PRE>! Loading somehost config
</PRE>
<LI>Check that your proxy is not playing games: it could be passing you
old pages despite the virtual host config.

<P><B>1: People can't transfer files or see directories on my FTP server</B><A NAME="f_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is a typical problem caused by the way FTP works. If there is a
firewall (some some kinds of router are the same) which does not allow
connections from the server to the client, file transfers (including
directory listings) will fail. You should tell your users to use 'passive'
connections.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: How do I use my D: drive for additional FTP space?</B><A NAME="f_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>You can move the entire FTP root anywhere you like - this is one way. You
can also define any number of FTP aliases, which point to different file
systems, CD-ROMs, etc. You can also put different FTP users' directories on
different disks. For instance if I log in to 'anonymous', you could set my
home directory to d:\anon.

<P><B>3: When exactly does Xitami read the FTP user file?</B><A NAME="f_3">&nbsp;</A>

<P><B>4: If I give a user only 'P' access to a directory they can't list it</B><A NAME="f_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Normally you'd use 'P' by itself for a directory meant purely for
uploads. I.e. a userid 'uploads' with a dedicated write-only directory.
If you use 'P' by itself on a subdirectory, the user will not be able to
'cd' into it.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>5: I'm having problems getting my FTP permissions right</B><A NAME="f_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The FTP permissions definitions are quite complex and it's easy to get
these wrong.  The most common mistake is when you define directory-level
protections.  For instance, if the ftproot is in 'ftproot', and a user
'guest' connects to 'guest' (a subdirectory of ftproot), then how do you
specify the protection for a subdirectory 'guest/pub'?  The correct form is:
<PRE>[pub]
    guest=..flags..
</PRE>
and not [guest/pub], [/pub], [/guest/pub] or any other combination.  The key
is that you have to look at the protected directory name from the point of
view of the logged-on user.  The user's home directory is []; the pub
subdirectory is [pub].
<P>To debug this kind of problem, enable server debugging, then check
debug.log. It'll indicate the actual permissions that were used to access
the directory.  Make sure you read the comments in ftpdirs.aut to see how
FTP authentication works.

<P><B>9: How do I set-up FTP virtual hosts?</B><A NAME="f_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami does not yet support this, and when it does, it will only allow
IP-based (as opposed to DNS-based) virtual hosting due to the way the FTP
protocol works. A simple workaround is to run multiple copies of Xitami, one
for each IP address, and each in its own home directory. Make sure to set
the LRWP port to different values for each server, and set the FTP ipaddress
and force-ip appropriately. Use the console version of Xitami to debug it,
since this displays any error messages nicely. The Windows GUI versions
don't, and you may just find yourself staring at a non-starting web server
without knowing what's going on.

<P><B>1: How do I use the Xitami log files?</B><A NAME="l_1">&nbsp;</A>
<P>There are many freeware and commercial logfile analysers; the Xitami
access logfiles are NCSA/HTTPd compatible and thus compatible with most
logfile analysers.  The Xitami.log file is used for server messages and
thus not suitable for analysis.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>2: Does the FTP server log logins, uploads, and downloads?</B><A NAME="l_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The FTP server logs uploads and downloads in the Xitami access log file,
by default.  To separate the FTP access log into a separate file, change
the Ftplog:filename configuration option.  This also applies to the error
log, specified by ftperrlog:filename.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>3: Why does access.log contain only numeric addresses?</B><A NAME="l_3">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami does not yet translate IP addresses into names since this is
very slow unless done asynchronously, and that's a lot of work.  The Xixlat
translator (supplied with Xitami) will do a fast log file translation.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>4: Can I use Microsoft's WINS protocol for analysing my log files?</B><A NAME="l_4">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes. This is extracted from Microsoft's documentation: "In Windows NT
4.0, Microsoft's implementation of DNS is tightly integrated with WINS. This
allows non-WINS clients to resolve NetBIOS names by querying a DNS server.
Administrators can now remove any static entries for Microsoft-based clients
in legacy DNS server zone files in favor of the dynamic WINS/DNS
integration. For example, if a non-Microsoft-based client wants to get to a
Web page on an HTTP server that is DHCP/WINS enabled, the client can query
the DNS server, the DNS server can query WINS and the name can be resolved
and returned to the client. Previous to the WINS integration, there was no
way to reliably resolve the name because of the dynamic IP addressing.
Please see the 'DNS and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0' white paper for details on
the WINS/DNS integration."  The upshot of this is that xixlat will work with
WINS if you have a WinNT 4.0 DNS server.

<P><B>5: My log file has this strange URL: webpages/http://hostname/file.htm</B><A NAME="l_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is caused by the browser (usually MSIE4) sending a HTTP1/1 proxy
request.  Xitami can not (yet) handle these.  This usually indicates that
someone has defined your web server as a proxy server.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>6: What's the logic behind the log file naming scheme? Is there any?</B><A NAME="l_6">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The log file naming schema is an attempt to manage what can become a
large number of files with pretty arbitrary names. This is how it works:
<UL>
<LI>When a log file is cycled, the new file is created with the
specified name, e.g. access.log.
<LI>The old file, if it exists, is renamed to a file with the same first two
letters, followed by six digits representing the year, month, and day, of
last modification of the file.  (In old versions of Xitami, the hour, minute
and second.)
<LI>If this name was already used, the file extension is changed to .000,
.001, .002, etc. until a unique name is found.

<P><B>7: I can't access the log files while Xitami is writing to them!</B><A NAME="l_7">&nbsp;</A>

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>8: My log files do not get updated until Xitami is restarted</B><A NAME="l_8">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This happens (on several operating systems) because the OS may not show
changes to a file until the file is closed by the process writing to it.
When you do a restart, Xitami closes its log files, and then you see all the
entries. At a guess the log files are being block buffered, which means that
they'll only be written out to the file once a block is full (probably
somewhere between 2K and 8K at a guess). This is a function of the way that
the runtime library handles file I/O.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>9: My computer crashed and now my log files are full of junk</B><A NAME="l_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>When the computer crashes, for whatever reason, it can leave open files
in an incomplete state. One symptom is that allocated blocks can contain
garbage from previous files, allocated to the new file, but not yet written
with data.  This is probably what happened to your log file.  In other words,
the junk is probably not what caused the crash, just random data that
happened to be on the hard disk when Xitami was writing to its log file.

<P>Just say 'iMatix' backwards -- it's simple! Okay, to be more precise...
There are two basic ways to pronounce this name; you can aspirate the 'X' as
'Sh', or you can keep it hard, as 'Ks'. In either case the accent is on the

<P><B>2: What are the main problems with Xitami today?</B><A NAME="m_2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>People also often ask for FrontPage support.  Besides the fact
that FrontPage uses an undocumented server interface, we think that if you
want to be tied to a single platform (Windows in this case) you can use the
platform-specific server (IIS in this case).  Xitami offers a long-term
approach, robust enough to survive several OS changes.

list is accessible to more people than a newsgroup.  We're looking for ways

<P><B>5: Why do I get errors on 'robots.txt'? What is this?</B><A NAME="m_5">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The various search engines (like AltaVista) use a 'web spider' or 'robot'
to scan and index websites. This often includes large amounts of junk that
make the resulting searches pretty useless. So, a standard mechanism has
evolved to make this work better. The 'Robot Exclusion Standard' specifies
that a file called 'robots.txt' in the home directory will indicate which
pages or directories should be ignored. This is not meant as any kind of
security device, just a 'hint'. So, most robots will ask for this file. If
the errors in the log files bother you, create an empty file in the webpages
directory called 'robot.txt'.  To ask all robots to skip your site, use
this:

<P><B>7: Why is the password file not encrypted?</B><A NAME="m_7">&nbsp;</A>
<P>In general if access to your server is secure, then the lack of
encryption is not a problem. If someone can read the Xitami directory on
your system, they can see the passwords. Note that even if you use a hashed
password file, it is often trivial to discover passwords using a
dictionary-based attack. It's therefore much better to concentrate on hiding
the password file than on encrypting it.  At some future date, Xitami will
support encrypted (hashed) passwords.

<P><B>8: Do I need a special license to use/sell/modify Xitami at work?</B><A NAME="m_8">&nbsp;</A>
<P>No, none.  Read the <A href="license.htm#license">Xitami license</A>.

<P><B>9: I want to write a great Xitami addon...</B><A NAME="m_9">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Excellent news!  Xitami is an Open Source project, and has benefitted
from many contributions, including people who ported the SFL library, wrote
plugs like the LRWP agent, wrote documentation, tested it, and so on.  You
will want to learn how to use our great tools - Libero, SFL, SMT.

<P><B>10: How do I rebuild the SFL under Windows using MSVC?</B><A NAME="m_10">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The simplest check-list is:
<OL>
<LI>Get the Xitami Windows source code distribution (this always contains
the most recent release of SFL).
<LI>Unzip into a directory; the SFL source code is put into src\sfl.
<LI>Create a new project, for a static library; change the options to
create an output file in the main directory (instead of debug/). I usually
call the library 'libsfl.lib'.
<LI>Add all source files called 'sfl*.c' from the src/sfl directory.
<LI>Build.
</OL>
For SMT, you can do the same, but there are some sources you want to leave
out: smttst*.c and smtschm.c.

<P><B>11: I'm building a Windows app based on Xitami, but it aborts</B><A NAME="m_11">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you try to mix Xitami with MFC, you'll get a server that stops running
after 60 seconds, or whatever you set the server:refresh interval to. This
is because MFC traps the timer signal Xitami uses, and handles it as an
abort. There may be workarounds for this, depending on how well you know
MFC.

<P><B>12: How do I rebuild Xitami under Windows using lcc-win32?</B><A NAME="m_12">&nbsp;</A>
<P>If you want to compile under Windows, you should download the Windows
source kit, not the Unix one - this will give you files with the correct
line endings (CRLF not LF). Then, you should set the environment variable
CCNAME to lcc and CCDIR to the lcc-win32 directory. Try the c.bat file on
one source, e.g. sflbits to make sure it works correctly, then run build.bat
in src/sfl. Copy sfl.h and libsfl.lib to src/smt, and run build.bat there
too. Lastly, when Xitami is built, be prepared to throw it away, since at
the time of writing, lcc-win32 had a bug which causes Xitami to halt when it
gets a timer signal -- see the following question.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>13: I compiled Xitami with lcc-win32 but it always aborts</B><A NAME="m_13">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Lcc is a wonderful little compiler but its runtime has a problem with
certain interrupts. Basically, when Xitami receives a timer signal, it
aborts. This hits after the refresh timeout, and when running CGIs. We have
notified the author of lcc, and provided a small test program that shows
this behaviour. It's quite clearly a bug in lcc. Apart from this problem,
we've found lcc to be fast, reliable, and in fact it's supported fully by
the SFL. I can recommend it for CGI programming (oh, one more caveat - no
support for ODBC as far as I could see).

<P><B>14: Why does iMatix.com use Apache, not Xitami?</B><A NAME="m_14">&nbsp;</A>
<P>iMatix.com is hosted by Ascentrix Technologies, Inc. an excellent web
hosting company (previously called AZC).  They use a customised version of
Apache with electronic commerce facilities.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>15: Why are there bugs in Xitami?</B><A NAME="m_15">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Any complex software is filled with bugs. Xitami is pretty good in this
respect, we reckon. Our policy is to fix those we can identify and localise,
depending on the severity of the problem. A bug that causes the server to
crash will make us run around a lot faster than a bug which causes some
obscure feature to work otherwise than documented.  Large amounts of money
will also tend to focus our attention.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>16: Why is Xitami free, and will it remain this way?</B><A NAME="m_16">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami is a product that we developed to demonstrate the quality of our
technology and to introduce people to iMatix Corporation.  This web server
will remain free software, and as the kernel for our commercial web server
products, will continue to be ported, improved, and maintained.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>17: Where can I get older versions of Xitami?</B><A NAME="m_17">&nbsp;</A>
<P>We keep one back version but not older ones.  You may be able to find
a specific version by searching through an FTP search engine like the
one at http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>18: Do you have any plans to incorporate SSL into Xitami?</B><A NAME="m_18">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami/Pro supports this.  E-mail us for details and prices.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>19: What is the future for Xitami?</B><A NAME="m_19">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Xitami will continue to be improved and extended, while keeping it a
server that you can install and set-up within minutes.  For professional
users, Xitami/Pro offers more sophisticated functions but these also take
more time to learn and configure.  Xitami will remain free software.

<P><A href="index13.htm#faqlink">[Top]</A><HR>
<P><B>20: Is Xitami year 2000 compatible?</B><A NAME="m_20">&nbsp;</A>
<P>Yes.

<H3><A NAME="TOC71">Overview</A></H3>

<P>Xitami supports the FTP (file transfer) protocol. The FTP service was
designed to be simple and easy to administer, while providing the security
and speed necessary for a web site. You can administer the FTP service from
the WBA screens, in the same way as you administer the rest of Xitami.

<P>The current implementation of FTP does not support virtual hosts, so the
FTP configuration applies to all virtual hosts defined for a web site.

<P>The FTP service recognises these commands, and handles those not marked
by '*':
<PRE>
 USER    PASV    STOU*   MAIL*   ALLO*   CWD     PWD     XMKD
 PASS    TYPE    SYST    MSND*   REST    CDUP    RMD     XRMD

<H3><A NAME="TOC72">FTP Configuration Options</A></H3>

<P>The configuration of the FTP service is handled by specific
sections in the standard configuration file.

<H4><A NAME="TOC73">The [FTP] Section</A></H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP service.
<DL>
<DT><TT><B>enabled</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether the FTP service is enabled or not. If you change this
option you must stop and restart the server for it to take effect. (The WBA
control panel 'Restart' action will not start the FTP service.)
<DD>Default: 1 (enabled).

<DT><TT><B>root</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the root directory for FTP logins, unless a specific
directory is defined for the current user.
<DD>Default: ftproot (below main Xitami directory).

<DT><TT><B>port</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the FTP connection port.  The port is shifted by the
portbase specified for the main HTTP service.  For instance if you
specify a port 21, and a portbase of 8000, your server will accept
FTP connections on port 8021 and HTTP connections on port 8080.
<DD>Default: 21 (the standard FTP port).

<DT><TT><B>timeout</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the time in seconds after which inactive control connections
are closed. An FTP session requires one control connection, plus one data
connection during file transfers. You should tune this timeout to suit the
requirements of your system. For instance, under an OS like Windows 95,
sockets are a limited resource, so a shorter timeout is a good idea. For
sites with a small user group, you can use high timeouts, which users
generally prefer.
<DD>Default: 300 (5 minutes)

<DT><TT><B>limit</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the maximum number of users that may login at once. On systems
that can handle lots of open sockets (e.g. Unix, OS/2, WinNT, Win98), you
may want to increase this. Xitami does not impose any fixed limit. If you
set this value to 0, it means 'no limit'.
<DD>Default: 25 users.
</DL>

<DT><TT><B>user-file</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the name of the user definition file. The syntax for this is
described below.
<DD>Default: ftpusers.aut.

<DT><TT><B>directory-file</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the name of the directory definition file.  The syntax for
this is described below.
<DD>Default: ftpdirs.aut.

<DT><TT><B>dirsort</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the sort order for directory listings.  You can sort by
file name, extension, size, or modification date/time using any combination
of the letters 'n', 'x', 's', and 't'.  For instance, dirsort=xnt will sort
by extension, then name, then time.  To sort in reverse order, use capital
letters.  For instance to show the most recent files first, use dirsort=T.
<DD>Default: n (sort by name).

<DT><TT><B>welcome</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user connects to the FTP server.
This can be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'. The file
can contain up to 2000 characters. Any lines that start with '#' are ignored
as comments. If you modify this file, it is safest to make a copy (call it
welcome.txt or something) and change this option to refer to the changed
file. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you reinstall the next latest
greatest version of Xitami.
<DD>Default: @ftphello.txt (an example file).

<DT><TT><B>user-at-host</B></TT>
<DD>This flag controls whether Xitami allows virtual hosts using the syntax
'username@hostname'.  This syntax is supported by some FTP clients, and
allows you to use multiple FTP virtual hosts on a single IP address.
<DD>Default: 1 (enabled).

<DT><TT><B>signoff</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user ends the FTP session. This can
be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'. The file can
contain up to 2000 characters. Any lines that start with '#' are ignored as
comments. If you modify this file, it is safest to make a copy (call it
goodbye.txt or something) and change this option to refer to the changed
file. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you reinstall the next latest
greatest version of Xitami.
<DD>Default: @ftpadios.txt (an example file).

<DT><TT><B>login-text</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user logs-in to the FTP server.
This can be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'.  The
file can contain up to 2000 characters.  Any lines that start with '#'
are ignored as comments.  If you modify this file, it is safest to make
a copy (call it login.txt or something) and change this option to
refer to the changed file.  Xitami will search for this file first in
the user's login directory, then in the main Xitami directory.
<DD>Default: @ftplogin.txt (an example file).

<DT><TT><B>email-check</B></TT>
<DD>If 1, the FTP server will check that the e-mail address supplied
for anonymous logins is a valid address.  The nature of the check is
not documented (it may just look for an '@' in the address).
<DD>Default: 0 (do not check addresses).

<DT><TT><B>http-aliases</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether the HTTP [Alias] section should be used by the
FTP service.  This can be useful in configurations where you want to
share the same data between services, but it can be a security risk
if you want to use FTP aliases to access directories outside the HTTP
space.
<DD>Default: 0 (disabled).

<DT><TT><B>soft-quota</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the default soft quota for FTP users who are subject to a
quota.  You can also specify quota values for individual users.  This
value is specified in megabytes, as a decimal number (using a decimal
point, not comma, even in Europe).  When a user exceeds their soft quota,
they start getting warning messages.
<DD>2.5

<DT><TT><B>hard-quota</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the default hard quota for FTP users who are subject to a
quota.  You can also specify quota values for individual users.  This
value is specified in megabytes, as a decimal number.  When a user exceeds
their hard quota, they cannot upload new files.
<DD>2.5

<DT><TT><B>webmask</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the set of clients that can connect to the FTP server.
Works in the same way as the HTTP <A href="index4.htm#webmasks">webmask option</A>.

<DT><TT><B>password-case</B></TT>
<DD>If 1, FTP passwords are case-sensitive.  If 0, passwords are always
converted to lower-case before validation. If you set this to 0, be sure to
use only lower-case passwords in the password file.
<DD>Default: 1 (case-sensitive)

<DT><TT><B>data-port</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the port at which data connections will be made.  Xitami
scans for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of ports.
The port is shifted by whatever value was used for the server portbase.
<DD>Default: 200.

<DT><TT><B>force-ip</B></TT>
<DD>Indicates whether passive connections must be forced to the IP
address specified in the 'ipaddress' option.
<DD>Default: 0 (do not force).

<DT><TT><B>ipaddress</B></TT>
<DD>The IP address used for passive connections.  If '*', accepts passive
connections on all local available IP addresses.
<DD>Default: '*'.
</DL>

<H4><A NAME="TOC74">The [FTPLog] Section</A></H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP access log.
<DL>
<DT><TT><B>enabled</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether FTP accesses are logged or not.  FTP accesses are
logged in a format similar to that used for HTTP accesses.
<DD>Default: 1 (accesses are logged).

<DT><TT><B>filename</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the filename for access logging.  This may be the same as
the main HTTP access log file.
<DD>Default: access.log.

<DT><TT><B></B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the cycle mode for the log file.
<DD>Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour;
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day;
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week;
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month, or
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only.
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

<DT><TT><B>local</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.
<DD>Default: 1 (include local addresses).
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="TOC75">The [FTP-Alias] Section</A></H3>

<P>This section lets you define multiple FTP file roots.  Each alias
alias specifies a name and a path.  For example:
<PRE>[FTP-Alias]
volume-c=C:</PRE>
<P>The alias name itself may not contain '/'. It is not case sensitive. FTP
aliases are only shown to 'root' users, i.e. those with an empty root value,
or those who have the 'aliases=1' option defined (see below). Like HTTP
aliases, the FTP alias is always the first component of a filename (e.g.
/volume-c/somefile).  Aliases are shown only if the user has no GET access,
and if the specified user's root directory actually exists.

<H4><A NAME="TOC76">The [FTPErrLog] Section</A></H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP error log.
<DL>
<DT><TT><B>enabled</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether FTP errors are logged or not.  FTP errors are
logged in a format similar to that used for HTTP errors.
<DD>Default: 1 (errors are logged).

<DT><TT><B>filename</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the filename for error logging. This may be the same as
the main HTTP error log file.
<DD>Default: error.log.

<DT><TT><B></B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the cycle mode for the log file.
<DD>Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour;
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day;
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week;
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month, or
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only.
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

<DT><TT><B>local</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.
<DD>Default: 1 (include local addresses).
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="TOC77">FTP User File Syntax</A></H3>

<P>The FTP user file defines all users that may log-in to the FTP
server.  This is a typical user file:

<PRE>
[Admin]
    Access=*
    Password=-
    Root=""
    Aliases=1           #   Will have access to aliases
[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=pub
[Guest]
    Access=G
    Root=c:\public\guest
[Upload]
    Access=P
    Password=upload
    Root=/tempfiles/upload
    Use-quotas=1
    Soft-quota=10
    Hard-quota=12
</PRE>

<P>The user name is specified like this: [Admin].  User names are
not case-sensitive.  The password may be any text.  The password
may be one of these special values:
<UL>
<LI>"*" - accepts anonymous logins.  If ftp:check-email is set to
1, will check that the password looks like a valid e-mail address.
<LI>"-" - rejects all logins for this user.  You can use this to
disable an account temporarily.  This is the default password for
accounts where no password is defined.
<LI>"" (blank) - does not ask for a password.  Use this only for
low-security (guest) accounts.
</UL>

<P>The access rights are any combination of:
<UL>
<LI>'G' - The user can list directories and get files from the server
<LI>'P' - The user can upload (put) files to the server.
<LI>'U' - The user can upload files to the server, but not overwrite
existing files.
<LI>'D' - The user can delete files on the server, and can rename files.
<LI>'M' - The user can create directories
<LI>'R' - The user can remove directories
<LI>'*' - The user can do everything (same as GPUDMR).
<LI>'-' - The user can do nothing; this can be used to disable access to a
specific alias, for instance.
</UL>

<P>The 'root' option defines where the user can work. If this is not
specified, the user can work anywhere below the FTP root directory. You can
also specify a full path, for instance:
<PRE>root=/home/users/guest
</PRE>

<P>The 'aliases' option defines whether or not a user has access to the
FTP aliases.  By default this is true for all 'root' users, i.e. those
with an empty root value.  You can override this default by specifying
an explicit value for the aliases option.

<P>Note that put-only directories should be treated as special cases, and
used only as a user's root directory.  You cannot 'chdir' to a put-only
directory.

<P>You can enable/disable quotas per user. We defined a 'soft quota' and a
'hard quota'.  Above the soft quota, the user gets warning messages. Above
the hard limit, uploads are refused, and warnings are sent to the web
server console.  The quota is calculated quite simply: it is the limit for
all files in the user's login directory and subdirectories. You can
therefore share a quota between users, or allocate a quota to individual
users. The site administrator can decide whether log files are part of the
quota or not, by putting them into the user's space, or into separate
(non-quota) directories.  For quotas to work, keep a user limited to the
login subtree.  I.e. do not allow writeable aliases.  Quotas are managed by
the three configuration keys: use-quota, soft-quota, and hard-quota.

<H3><A NAME="TOC78">FTP Directory File Syntax</A></H3>

<P>The FTP directory file defines access rights per user for specific
directories. Each section is a directory name; either an absolute directory
(e.g. [/pub]) or a child of the ftproot directory (specified without a
leading slash: [pub]).  To define rights for an alias directory, you must
use the child's root directory plus the alias directory.  For instance if
you define an aliase like 'info' which maps to a CD-ROM drive, protection
for a user 'guest' who's initial root directory is 'guest' looks like this:
<PRE>[guest/info]
</PRE>

<P>For instance, if the guest user has access to aliases, but you want to
disable access to the 'info' alias, you could use an entry like this:
<PRE>[guest/info]
guest=-
</PRE>

<P>A directory entry covers all child directories, unless a more
specific directory is defined for that user.  Directory names are not
case significant.

<P>Each entry specifies access rights for a user; the user must have
been defined in the FTP users file.  The same access right codes are
used.

<H3><A NAME="TOC79">An Example FTP Configuration</A></H3>

<P>This material for this section was provided by Paul C. Fretz,
&lt;pcfretz@mha.shalom.k12.pa.us&gt;.

<P>Install Xitami in its own directory.  Have your web pages in a
separate directory such as c:\webpages

<P>Setup 'defaults.cfg' to include:
<PRE>[Server]
    Webpages=c:\webpages
[Ftp]
    Root=c:\webpages
    welcome="Welcome"                   #   text or @filename
    login-text="Login"                  #   text or @filename
    user-file=ftpulist.aut              #   Users authorization file
[Security]
    password-case=1                     #   Case-sensitive passwords
    filename=password.aut               #   Authorization file
<PRE>

<P>Setup 'ftpulist.aut' to include:
<PRE>[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=AnonFTP
[WEBRoot]
    Access=G
    Password=123456
    Root=""
[U101]
   Access=GPDMR
   Password=123101
   Root=User/U101
[U102]
   Access=GPDMR
   Password=123102
   Root=User/U102
</PRE>

<P>There are several things to keep in mind:
<OL>
<LI>The directory structure for the above is as follows:
<PRE>c:\webpages
       |-AnonFTP
       |-User
          |-U101
          |-U102
          |-...
</PRE>
<LI>For FTP access to c:\webpages\User\U101 the userid is U101 and the
password is 123101.
<LI>The WEBRoot entry gives FTP 'get' access to your whole website.
</OL>

<P>Setup 'password.aut' as follows if you want to password protect the same
subdirectories for browsing:
<PRE>
[/admin]
    Admin=-             #   By default, admin access is disabled
    Webmask=local       #   <== when 'local', remote access is not allowed
[User/U101]
   U101=123101
[User/U102]
   U102=123102
</PRE>

<OL>
<LI>'Admin=-' disables web-based administration. Change this if you wish.
<LI>When you try to access with your browser anything located in
c:\webpages\User\U101 (by using http://yourdomain/User/U101/) the browser
will ask for user name and password. The username is U101 and the password
is 123101. The first line [User/U101] refers to the subdirectory. The second
line U101=123101 is the user name and password and does not have to be
anything like the first line.
<LI>A scheme like this allows users to have their own private subdirectory
on the web server. They can access just theirs by FTP using Netscape or a
program like WS-FTP. These pages are then available for anyone to browse
or if you protect them as shown above in 'password.aut', they are private.
<LI>Note that the default Xitami configuration requires that CGIs start with
the string '/cgi-bin'.  The above configuration does not allow users to
upload and run arbitrary CGIs, something that usually presents a security
risk.

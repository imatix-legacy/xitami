Notes for contributors

These are the standards and conventions we use for our source code.

General:

    - CRLF format if possible, but Unix LF format is okay
    - no tabs
    - keep lines to 80 or fewer columns

Comments:

    - Respect the standard file headers
    - Update 'Revised:' date when you make a change
    - Add your email address if you're the author
    - ANSI C... so no C++ style comments
    - Blank line before a comment
    - Two spaces after the opening '*'
    - Indent comments to match the code, end */ in column 78
    - Comments on same line start in column 41
    - Use this format for multiline comments:
        /*  This is a multiline
         *  comment
         */

Indentation and whitespace:

    - 4-space indentation, not using tabs
    - if (condition)
          single-statement;

    - if (condition)
        {
          statement1;
          statement2;
        }
    - blank line before large if statement
    - no blank line after closing {
    - a space before (, after ): eg.
      function (argument, argument, argument);
    - pointer-> somefield
    - structure.somefield

Dialogued programs (using Libero):
    - let Libero generate module stubs

<H1>Welcome To Xitami v2.4d7</H1>

<P>Welcome to Xitami, the <EM>fast</EM> web server. You should be accessing
these pages through Xitami now. To configure the server, use the
<A HREF="/admin">web-based admin</A> function. This is password-protected. On
UNIX and OS/2 you should edit the password file (xitami.aut or equivalent)
after installation. Under Windows this is done at installation time.

<H2>Why is Xitami Fantastic?</H2>
<P>Xitami is free, fast, and simply really good at its job.  This is a
professional web server that will run out of the box but lets you configure
it every possible way.  Many of the best ideas in Xitami came from the
thousands of people who use it every day for their intranet and internet web
sites.  It won't crash when you start using it heavily, and it won't
slow-down your system.

<H2>The Technology Behind Xitami</H2>
<P>Xitami is at least as fast as any other web server. It is based on the
high-performance <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/smt/">SMT</A> multithreading technology developed by iMatix.
SMT is Open Source technology, freely available as source code.

<BR>Xitami is portable to 16-bit and 32-bit Windows, to OS/2, most Unix
systems, and Digital OpenVMS. It uses the <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl/">SFL</A> portability library
developed by iMatix. SFL is Open Source technology, also freely available as
source code.

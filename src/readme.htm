<P>With an ANSI C compiler, you can rebuild Xitami on your system. Note that

the Xitami sources are ANSI C/POSIX compatible, and should build cleanly on

the majority of UNIX systems.  We and other people have tested Xitami on

these systems:

<UL>

<LI>Linux

<LI>IBM RS/6000 AIX

<LI>HP/UX

<LI>Digital UNIX (OSF/1)

<LI>SunOS and Solaris

<LI>SCO UNIXWare and OpenServer

<LI>SGI Irix

<LI>FreeBSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD

</UL>



<P>To install the source kit you need about 15Mb of disk space. You can

download the Xitami sources as a compressed tar file (.tgz). To unpack

a tgz file you need GNU gunzip.  Download the

<A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/suni24d7.tgz">suni24d7.tgz</A> source kit.  To unpack the compressed file,

give these commands:

<PRE>gunzip suni24d7.tgz

tar -xvf suni24d7.tar

</PRE>



<P>The resulting directory structure includes the full sources for Xitami

(basically the <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl/">SFL</A> and <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/smt/">SMT</A> packages), plus a build script,

<TT>xibuild</TT>, plus the directories and web pages you need to get started

with Xitami.



<P>The <TT>xibuild</TT> script compiles Xitami and installs the executable

program in the top directory (where <TT>xibuild</TT> is located). To run

<TT>xibuild</TT>, give these commands:



<PRE>chmod +x xibuild

./xibuild</PRE>



<P>When you have built Xitami, run xitami, then connect with any web

browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot

run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if

another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the

'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For

example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP

service on port 5021. You would then connect using

<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.



<P>If Xitami does not build cleanly on your system, the problem will usually

lie in non-standard code in the SFL library upon which Xitami is based. It's

possible that your system (or compiler) does not do what SFL expects. In

general the only file which you may need to change is the prelude.h file in

the SFL directory. Read the SFL doc if you think you want to make changes to

this library (it's pretty simple, really, and many people done this).
